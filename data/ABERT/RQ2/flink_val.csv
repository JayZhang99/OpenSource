"[FLINK-3267] Disable reference tracking in Kryo fallback serializerBefore this commit, Kryo runs extra logic to track and resolve repeated references tothe same object (similar as JavaSerialization)This disables reference tracking because  - reference tracking is costly  - it is virtually always unnecessary in the datatypes used in Flink  - it is inconsistent with Flink's own serialization (which does not do reference tracking)  - it may have problems if elements are read in a different order than they are written.This closes #1528",0

"[FLINK-18957] Implement logical request bulk tracking in SlotSharingExecutionSlotAllocatorAfter we started to allocate physical slots and then logical slots from them for a bulk request in SlotSharingExecutionSlotAllocator,we need to track the fulfil-ability of the logical slot request bulk. If it cannot be fulfil after the requested timeout,we have to cancel all logical slot request futures to fail the bulk allocation.The underlying shared physical slots may be occupied by logical slots from different bulks.Hence, a physical slot request should be canceled only if there are no logical slots/bulks which need it.This ensures we will not wait indefinitely if all required slots for a bulk cannot be fully fulfilled.Track fulfil-ability steps:- Create a SharingPhysicalSlotRequestBulk to track  - all physical requests and  - logical slot requests (logical slot requests only which belong to the bulk)- Mark physical slot request fulfilled in SharingPhysicalSlotRequestBulk, once its future is done- If any physical slot request fails then clear the LogicalSlotRequestBulk to stop the fulfil-ability check- Schedule a fulfil-ability check in PhysicalSlotRequestBulkChecker for the SharingPhysicalSlotRequestBulk- In case of timeout cancel/fail the logical slot requests of the bulk in SharedSlot(s)This closes #13181.",2

"[FLINK-9377] [core] (part 1) Extend TypeSerializerConfigSnapshot as a factory for restoring serializersThis commit is the first step towards removing serializers fromcheckpointed state meta info and making Flink checkpoints Javaserialization free.Instead of writing serializers in checkpoints, and trying to read thatto obtain a restore serializer at restore time, we aim to only write theconfig snapshot as the single source of truth and use it as a factory tocreate a restore serializer.This commit adds the restoreSerializer() method and signatures to theTypeSerializerConfigSnapshot interface. Use of the method, as well asproperly implementing the method for all serializers, will beimplemented in follow-up commits.To allow for the codebase to still build, the restoreSerializer() methodcurrently returns the originating serializer directly. This implies thefact that the originating serializer has been injected to the configsnapshot appropriately.",5

"[FLINK-15758][MemManager] Release segment and its unsafe memory in GC CleanerAfter #9747, managed memory is allocated from UNSAFE, not as direct nio buffers as before 1.10.The releasing of segments released also underlying unsafe memory which is dangerous in generalas there can be still references to java objects giving access to the released memory. If this referenceever leaks, the illegal memory access can result in memory corruption of other code parts w/o even segmentation fault.The solution can be similar to how Java handles direct memory limit:- underlying byte buffers of segments are registered to phantom reference queue with a Java GC cleaner which releases the unsafe memory- all allocations and reservations are managed by a memory limit and an atomic available memory- if available memory is not enough while reserving, the phantom reference queue processing is triggered to run hopefully discovered by GC cleaners- memory can be released directly or in a GC cleanerThe GC is also sped up by nulling out byte buffer reference in `HybridMemorySegment#free` which is inaccessible anyways after freeing.Otherwise also a lot of tests, which hold accidental references to memory segments, have to be fixed to not hold them.The `MemoryManager#verifyEmpty` checks that everything can be GC'ed at the end of the tests andafter slot closing in production to detect memory leaks if any other references are held, e.g. from `HybridMemorySegment#wrap`.This closes #11109.",3

Change Client to accept new PlanWithJars instead of PactProgramPlanWithJars is a simple wrapper around a Plan and a list of jars thathave to be submitted with the plan. This is necessary to enable theRemoteExecutor that simple accepts a Plan and a list of jars without thewhole PlanAssembler and jar extraction business of PactProgram.PactProgram now has a getPlanWithJars() method that does the old jarextraction and simply creates the PlanWithJars wrapper with the planthat it created from the PlanAssembler in the jar. Client no longercares about the jar extraction logic and does also no longer calldeleteExtractedLibraries (since it does not have a reference to thePactProgram anymore). The code that creates the PactProgram is notresponsible for calling deleteExtractedLibraries after the job issubmitted.,4

Although this problem can be fixed by increasing the number of total buffers, the deadlock may not be acceptable. Therefore, this commit tries to failover the current execution when the timeout occurs and tips users to increase the number of buffers in the exception message.",1

"[FLINK-5890] [gelly] GatherSumApply broken when object reuse enabledThe initial fix for this ticket is not working on larger data sets.Reduce supports returning the left input, right input, a new object, ora locally reused object. The trouble with the initial fix was that thereturned local object was reusing fields from the input tuples.The problem is with ReduceDriver#run managing two values (reuse1 andreuse2) and with a third, local value returned byGatherSumApplyIteration.SumUDF. After the first grouping value.f1 ==reuse1.f1. Following UDF calls may swap value.f1 and reuse2.f1, whichcauses reuse1.f1 == reuse2.f1. With an odd number of swaps the nextgrouping will reduce with reuse1 and reuse2 sharing a field anddeserialization will overwrite stored values.The simple fix is to only use and return the provided inputs.This closes #3515",1

"[FLINK-11064] [table] Setup a new flink-table module structureThis commit splits the flink-table module into multiple submodules inaccordance with FLIP-32 (step 1).The new module structure looks as follows:flink-table-common       ^       |flink-table-api-java <------- flink-table-api-scala       ^                                 ^       |                                 |flink-table-api-java-bridge    flink-table-api-scala-bridge       ^       |flink-table-plannerThe module structure assumes that the type system has been reworked suchthat only one table environment exists for both Java and Scala users.The module `flink-table-planner` contains the content of the old`flink-table` module. From there we can distribute ported classes totheir final module without breaking backwards compatibility orforce users to update their dependencies again.For example, if a user wants to implement a pure table program in Scala,`flink-table-api-scala` and `flink-table-planner` need to beadded to the project.Until we support pure table programs, `flink-table-api-scala/java-bridge`and `flink-table-planner` need to be added to the project.This closes #7587.",1

"[FLINK-16408] Bind user code class loader to lifetime of Job on TaskExecutorThis commit binds the user code class loader to the lifetime of a JobTable.Job on the TaskExecutor. This means that the TaskExecutor will not release the user code class loader as long as it contains an allocated slot for the respective job. This will ensure that a TaskExecutor can reuse the user code class loader across failovers (task and JM failovers). By reusing user code class loaders Flink will avoid to reload classes and, thus, decrease the pressure it puts on the JVM's metaspace. This will significantly improve situations where a class leak exists because Flink won't deplete the JVM's metaspace under recoveries.In order to achieve this, the LibraryCacheManager has been changed. The LibraryCacheManager only supports to register a LibraryCacheManager.ClassLoaderLease for a given job. As long as there is a single valid ClassLoaderLease, the LibraryCacheManager will not release the associated user code class loader. A LibraryCacheManger.ClassLoaderLease needs to be resolved in order to create and then obtain the user code class loader. This is done via LibraryCacheManager.ClassLoaderHandle#getOrResolveClassLoader. Upon calling this method the first time, one specifies the set of jars and class paths the user code class loader should be started with. Every subsequent call to this method will ensure that the underlying class loader contains the set of specified jars and class paths. If this is not the case, then this method will fail. Differently said, the system only supports one user code class loader per job at the moment.Once the owner of the LibraryCacheManager.ClassLoaderLease no longer needs the user code class loader, it should call LibraryCacheManager.ClassLoaderLease#close in order to invalidate the lease. Once all leases for a given job are invalidate, the LibraryCacheManager will release the underlying user code class loader.At the moment, there is only a single lease per job which is owned by the JobTable.Job and will be created when the JobTable.Job will be created. That way we ensure that the user code class loader lives as long as the JobTable.Job.In order to ensure that we reuse the user code class loader as long as the TaskExecutor has allocated slots for a given job, TaskExecutorSlotLifetimeTest#testUserCodeClassLoaderIsBoundToSlot has been added.",1

"[FLINK-13100][network] Fix the bug of throwing IOException while FileChannelBoundedData#nextBufferThe implementation of FileChannelBoundedData#nextBuffer assumes that there is always an available buffer, otherwise an IOException is thrownand it always assumes that pool of two buffers is enough (before using the 3rd buffer, first one was expected to be recycled already). But inthe case of pending flush operation (when the socket channel is not writable while netty thread is calling writeAndFlush method), the firstfetched buffer from FileChannelBoundedData has not been recycled while fetching the second buffer to trigger next read ahead, which breaks theabove assumption.In order to fix this problem, we make read ahead is not always available for FileChannelBoundedData. If there are no available buffers to readthe next data, we retrigger the read ahead while recycling buffer via ResultSubpartitionView#notifyDataAvailable.",5

[FLINK-3909] replace Maven Failsafe with SurefireFailures during execution of the integration tests with the MavenFailsafe plugin were silently ignored on Travis with Maven version3.2.5. The problem is that failures are not passed on correctly from the'integration-test' phase (where failures are recorded and tolerated) tothe 'verify' phase.The cause of the error is most likely SUREFIRE-1127. An exception in the'integration-test' is sometimes not flushed back to disk where it isevaluated in the 'verify' phase.

If concurrentlythe view is queried for a buffer it might get null, whichis only allowed if the view was released.Because the release is only forwarded out of the lock scope,this can happen before the release has propagated.As a solution, we check the parent release status as well in theview.

"[FLINK-16972][network] LocalBufferPool eagerly fetches global segments to ensure proper availability.Before this commit, availability of LocalBufferPool depended on a the availability of a shared NetworkBufferPool. However, if multiple LocalBufferPools simultaneously are available only because the NetworkBufferPool becomes available with one segment, only one of the LocalBufferPools is truly available (the one that actually acquires this segment).The solution in this commit is to define availability only through the guaranteed ability to provide a memory segment to the consumer. If a LocalBufferPool runs out of local segments it will become unavailable until it receives a segment from the NetworkBufferPool. To minimize unavailability, LocalBufferPool first tries to eagerly fetch new segments before declaring unavailability and if that fails, the local pool subscribes to the availability to the network pool to restore availability asap.Additionally, LocalBufferPool would switch to unavailable only after it could not serve a requested memory segment. For requestBufferBuilderBlocking that is too late as it entered the blocking loop already.Finally, LocalBufferPool now permanently holds at least one buffer. To reflect that, the number of required segments needs to be at least one, which matches all usages in production code. A few test needed to be adjusted to properly capture the new requirement.",1

Sending a (poison) letter with a closed mailbox willtrigger an MailboxStateException, which acts as a safety net and reportsillegal mailbox accesses in respect to its state.To avoid the situation, the enqueuing of the poison letter is more nowrobust. It checks for the mailbox being in the correct state (OPEN) orelse will not enqueue the poison letter, which would not have an effectanyways as the mailbox loop has already been terminated.Since the check and the enqueuing of the letter are non-atomic, another(much more unlikely) race condition would have been introduced. Hence,there is now a convenience method to TaskMailbox to run code under theinternal lock, such that MailboxProcessor can atomically check ifmailbox is still open and enqueuing poison letter.",1

"[FLINK-19317] Make EventTime the default TimeCharacteristicThis is part of the FLIP-134 (Batch execution for the DataStream API)work.Event time is the only sensible time characteristic for batchprocessing. We therefore change the default value of theTimeCharacteristic from ProcessingTime to EventTime. This means theDataStream API programs that were using event time before now just workwithout manually changing this setting. Processing-time programs willalso still work, because using processing-time timers is not dependenton the TimeCharacteristic. DataStream programs that don't set aTimestampAssigner or WatermarkStrategy will also still work if theydon't use operations that don't rely on (event-time) timestamps.  Thisis true for both BATCH and STREAMING execution mode.With this change, users don't need to callsetStreamTimeCharacteristic(EventTime) anymore. We will make sure theylearn of this by deprecating the method in a follow-up commit.The only real user-visible change of this is that programs that used theKeyedStream.timeWindow()/DataStream.timeWindow() operation, which isdependent on the TimeCharacteristic will now use event time by default.We don't think this operation is useful because the behaviour can besurprising. We recommend users always use an explicit processing-timewindow or event-time window.We also change the default watermark interval from 0 (disabled) to 200to match the previous behaviour of callingsetStreamTimeCharacteristic(EventTime).",1

For small records, this overhead can cause even 20% performance regression. This patch aims to solve the problem.In fact, the hash-based implementation is a nature way to achieve the goal of sorting records by partition index. However, it incurs some serious weaknesses. For example, when there is no enough buffers or there is data skew, it can waste buffers and influence compression efficiency which can cause performance regression.This patch solves the issue by dynamically switching between the two implementations, that is, if there are enough buffers, the hash-based implementation will be used and if there is no enough buffers, the sort-based implementation will be used.This closes #18505.",1
