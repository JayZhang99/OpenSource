Bug 795510 - SYS_gettid is not available on non-Linux system.I could not find for sure what to use on FreeBSD instead, so let's justnot get this information there. It is quite useful information to knowwhere thread traces were asked from, but it is more important to makesure the program can be compiled everywhere. Also we can just checkwhich thread has gimp_stack_trace*() calls. Thus it can be seen asredundant information in any case.SYS_gettid is apparently defined as a macro, so let's simply check forit being defined.	5

app: allow to toggle the histogram dialog between gamma and linearChange GimpHistogram to take a "gboolean linear" parameter and alwayshonor that parameter, so both kinds of histograms can now be createdfor all drawables.Add a horrible "Linear" toggle to the histogram dockable which alwaysdefaults to the active layer's actual pixel format, but can beswitched at any time. This UI is ugly and needs to change.On the PDB, default to gamma-corrected if the plug-in is unaware ofhigher precision, and to the drawable's native pixel format otherwise.Other places using histograms (e.g. levels, curves) are unchanged.	4

file-compressor: Add support for xz compressed files (bug #683159)This commit causes a compiler warning because string literals are oftype signed char, and we use a character out of the signed range in themimetype for xz.

app: Use SHM transport for data transfer for displayRecent Cairo uses SHM transports when available, and exposes the abilityfor its users to manage images shared between it and the display.This allows us to eliminate copies, and if the architecture supports iteven to upload directly into GPU addressable memory without any copies(all in normal system memory so we suffer no performance penalty whenapplying the filters). The caveat is that we need to be aware of thesynchronize requirements, the cairo_surface_flush andcairo_surface_mark_dirty, around access to the transport image. Toreduce the frequency of these barriers, we can subdivide the transportimage into small chunks as to satisfy individual updates and delay thesynchronisation barrier until we are forced to reuse earlier pixels.Note this bumps the required Cairo version to 1.12, and please be awarethat the XSHM transport requires bug fixes from cairo.git (will be1.12.12)v2: After further reflections with Mitch, we realized we can share thetransport surface between all canvases by attaching it to the commonscreen.v3: Fix a couple of typos in insert_node() introduced when switchingvariables names.v4: Encapsulating within an image surface rather than a subsurface washiding the backing SHM segment from cairo, causing it to allocatefurther SHM resources to stream the upload. We should be able to use asub-surface here, but it is more convenient to wrap the pixels in animage surface for rendering the filters (and conveniently masking thecallee flushes from invalidating our parent transport surface).Cc: Michael Natterer <mitch@gimp.org>	5

libgimp, libgimpconfig: recognize RGB boxed args containing GimpRGB.Still the same problem as ever with the Python binding where we have ahard time creating GParamSpec, hence we make them from objectproperties.See: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pygobject/-/issues/227#note_570031But then again, the Python binding way to create GObject properties doesnot seem to give us a way to use our custom param types (or I didn'tfind how). So when I create a property with Gimp.RGB type in Python, itdoesn't appear as a GIMP_PARAM_SPEC_RGB to our C code, but as aG_PARAM_SPEC_BOXED. So my trick is to check the value type instead.Note that I check the default value, but in reality it doesn't seem towork much either. Better than no support at all anyway.	1

app: fix XOR cursor drawing artifactsSwitch to a completely new PangoLayout managing stategy: The drawingcode relies on text_tool->layout being a view on text_tool->text_buffer,if they get out of sync, drawing is b0rk.Therefore, split the update_layout() function into clear_layout()(which kill the layout) and ensure_layout() (which creates the layoutif it doesn't exist).Whenever the buffer gets modified, pause the draw tool before themodification so the old cursor/selection undraw, then clear thelayout. Resuming the draw tool will automatically re-create the layoutfor the buffer's new contents.Also switch off any clipping for cursor and selection, so we can atleast see that our input has some effect, even if we don't actuallysee the edited text because it's out-of-layer.	1

app: add virtual transform/type-conversion functions to GimpLayerThe GimpLayer implementation of the GimpItem transform functions,and the GimpDrawable convert_type() function, apply their operationto both the layer and its mask.  The subclasses of GimpLayer --GimpGroupLayer and GimpTextLayer -- override some of thesefunctions, providing their own logic for the layer part, andduplicating the mask part.Avoid this duplication by adding a set of virtual transform andtype-conversion functions to GimpLayer.  Have the GimpLayerimplementaion of the corresponding GimpItem and GimpDrawablefunctions use these functions to apply the operation to the layer,while taking care of the mask themselves.  Have GimpLayer'ssubclasses override the new virtual functions, instead of theGimpItem and GimpDrawable ones.Note that the existing implementation of convert_type() inGimpTextLayer neglected to convert the mask, hence text layer masksretained their old format after conversion.  This issue is fixed asa side effect of this commit.	0

Bug 795909 - Multiple images opened with floating selection ...... closing one of them crashes GIMPGimpSymmetry keeps a strong reference to the drawable passed togimp_symmetry_set_origin() until the next call to set_origin(), oruntil it's destroyed.  This can unnecessarily extend the lifetimeof the drawable.  In particular, it can extend the lifetime of afloating selection past the destruction of the image mask, duringimage destruction, which results in a NULL mask pointer ingimp_layer_invalidate_boundary(), called when detaching thefloating selection as part of its destructor.Add gimp_symmetry_clear_origin(), which clears the origin set usinggimp_symmetry_set_origin(), dropping the reference to the drawable,and call it in gimp_paint_core_paint() after painting.  This avoidsextending the lifetime of the drawable, and fixes the bug.	0

This is whatblocked me so far to remove this whole listing of PNG variants for ourvector icon themes. Otherwise they would be gone by now.I really wonder as well about all these size categories. Not that theyare not needed when in PNG format, but because it feels like nobody hasreally taken the time to list which icons are needed in which size foryears.

libgimpwidgets: new GimpLabelColor widget (color area with a label).I tried to have a not too overwhelming API, so we just ask for the labeland initial color at construction. We keep sane defaults for the restand let people tweak the result by getting the color area widgetsthemselves (if they need to force-showing flat colors or change the dragbuttons in particular).Another thing I wondered about was the initial size of the color area.Without a size request or being in some container expanding itschildren (which may also be ugly), it ends up too small. I can imaginesuch widget being used especially when you want to display severalcolor rectangles next to each other with a label each. So I just set itthis way. Anyone is free to request a resize after constructing theobject.Last but not least, the position of the label was especially of interesthere. For my idea of a list of colors, I could definitely imagine colorblocks aligned with vertically-oriented labels above or below. It mightbe worth adding an API for this later on.	1

build: let's now build the Windows installer with meson.The meson build still has a bunch of issues and build bugs compared tothe autotools build, nevertheless the last blocker issue was dealt witha few days ago (PDB source generation).Moreover since the meson build on Windows especially makes such dramaticdifference, in terms of build speed, this is a big improvement forWindows contributor's comfort, and as such is one less barrier of entry.Anyway I believe that most Windows developers build GIMP with meson nowso sticking on autotools on this platform is just counter-productive.This is why it was decided to now make meson the recommended buildsystem on Windows, as a further step toward a move to meson. It is stillnot the recommended build system on the other platforms yet.	5

app, po: remove GimpControllerMouse code.The mouse controller had many limitations:* It was not per-device.* It was a long hard-coded list of events, which made its evolution  annoying and scrolling the list boring.* It was starting at button 8, while the first buttons were supposed to  be hardcoded interactions. And it stopped at button 12, while some  device might have more buttons nowadays. See !386.* The "Grab event" does not seem to work in many cases, according to  feedbacks.The new GimpModifiersEditor will now handle any button (except the firstbutton, which is reserved for tools), you can even override or changedefault canvas actions (panning, rotation, etc.). It should not belimited with a max button number either (though I haven't tested with adevice really having a lot of buttons since I don't have any such devicebut I did emulate huge button numbers on my stylus with xsetwacom and itdid work well; hopefully I'll get feedbacks). And now it can even runcustom actions.So basically it should deprecate the mouse controller as the modifierseditor can do everything the controller could, and more (unless I missedanything).	2

plug-ins: make various usage of g_file_replace() safer.As I did on app/, finalizing an output stream also implicitly flushesand closes it. Hence if an export ended with an error, we'd end up withincomplete data file (possibly overwriting a previously exported image).Only 2 plug-ins I haven't fixed yet are file-tiff-io and file-gif-save.The later one don't even clean up its memory (which somehow is good hereas at least the output stream is never finalized hence sane files arenot overwritten in case of errors).

po-windows-installer: fix double escaped ampersand in XML for the…… Windows installer localization.There are kind of 2 separate bugs here:- Direct i18n.gettext() to the proper data directory where to find the  ITS file. Otherwise `meson compile gimp30-windows-installer-pot` and  `meson compile gimp30-windows-installer-update-po` complained about  not knowing XML and falling back to C, which is obviously a problem:> /usr/bin/xgettext: warning: file 'build/windows/installer/lang/setup.isl.xml.in' extension 'xml' is unknown; will try C- Set gt:escapeRule to "no" in the ITS file, otherwise the XML entity is  kept as-is in the po file (i.e. "&amp;" stays "&amp;" inside the po  files), but it's considered as raw text when merged back to XML, i.e.  that the '&' is properly converted to a XML entity, so we end up with  a double escape "&amp;amp;".  Now the po file will have a '&' which will still be converted to XML  entity at merge time. This is actually most likely better than asking  translators to handle XML entities themselves (with the possibility to  make typos and break the XML entity).See https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?58643	0

app: layers-text-tool should give the focus to the canvas.If focus is on the layer list for instance, running this action fromright-click menu raises the on-canvas toolbar, ready for edition, with avisible text cursor.

gitlab-ci: improve artifacts settings.First replace the "when: on_failure" rule by a "when: always". We indeedalways want to get log artifact so that we can study a build ifnecessary (neither only on failure nor on success; really on all cases,since even an apparently successful build may have issues we might wantto diagnose).Also expire all artifacts at 1 week (it seems the default on GNOME'sGitlab is 4 weeks; we don't need to keep these so long. Even a few daysmight be enough actually).As for the artifacts contents, keep the build dirs rather than theinstall dirs. Build dirs allow to check configuration logs and otherkind of logs which are the most useful when diagnosing a failed build.Now install dirs are also interesting. Maybe we should provide themagain at some point. We'll see. For now I comment them out.Still keep the install dir for dependencies though, since it seems thisis how data are passed from one job to another.Note that ideally we would like to provide different artifacts dependingon failure or success but apparently this is currently not possible.See: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/18744Also not sure why for GIMP, the CI was only keeping the build app/tests/directory. We should really keep the whole dir.	3

Adds "fill" arrange modes to the Align ToolThe Align Tool had to be used in a very hacky way if oneintended to evenly distribute items across an image,or other reference object (it would actually require one tocalculate the item spacing out of GIMP). This adds verticaland horizontal fill modes: the reference object is dividedin N equal segments, where N is the number of items,and each item is placed in the center of one ofthese segments. The existing "offset" parameteris used as an extra margin for the distribution,and can be set to negative values, so that the items caneven get moved outside the boundaries of the reference object.	4

tools: invert-svg is to be built natively for the build OS.Partially reverts commit 84439a874860c517838c4d5969b353ced1c31b1a.The fact that tools/invert-svg was kind of manually compiled was onpurpose. Using the automake syntax with any of the *_PROGRAMS compilesfor the host OS, but this tool is only for compile-time.This fixes cross-compilation.As for compute_svg_viewbox, let's not build it for now because itspurpose was to help proper extraction of SVG icons from a single SVGfile. Unfortunately librsvg was not providing acceptable results anywayso right now all SVG icons are manually exported. We keep the code forfuture use when the library will improve.	1

plug-ins: do not show our own dialog with Freedesktop screenshot portal.Today I have only re-tested the GNOME implementation (in particular notthe KDE one) of the portal API org.freedesktop.portal.Screenshot but Iassume it is similar because the dbus function does not provide anyuseful options anyway. This is why the portal comes with its own dialogproviding the various common screenshot features (delay, window picking,area selection, etc.). Showing our dialog first is therefore redundant.Also I updated setting the monitor profile only in the case where theloaded image result from the portal did not have an embedded profile. Tobe fair, the GNOME implementation at least does not embed a profile tothis day. So this is only for the future case where they will finally dothe right thing and embed the display profile (or for other desktops'implementations where they maybe already do the right thing).	2

But looking at the gir file, all interestinginterface methods are associated to the Config record. So let's just gowith the [struct@Config] proposed by the warning.In any case, something feels wrong or broken here, but we need to fixthis for the CI. I hope Niels can look at it at some point.	0

app: flush async-operations queue when setting async thread count to 0In gimp-parallel, always flush the async-operations queue (byexecuting all remaining operations on the caller thread) whensetting the async-pool thread count to 0 (as happens when settingGEGL_THREADS=1, per the previous commit,) and not only whenshutting GIMP down.  Otherwise, pending asynchronous operationscan "get lost" when setting GEGL_THREADS to 1.Additionally, in gimp_gegl_init(), initialize gimp-parallel beforebefore connecting to GimpGeglConfig's "notify::num-processors"signal, so that the number of async threads is set *before*GEGL_THREADS, in order to avoid setting GEGL_THREADS to 1 whileasync operations are still executing.Also, allow setting the number of gimp-parallel-distribute threadswhile a gimp-parallel-distribute function is running (which canhappen if gimp-parallel-distribute is used in an async operation,as is the case for histogram calculation), by waiting for theparallel-distribute function to finish before setting the number ofthreads.	1

GimpArray: Add missing array length GIR annotation	1
Issue #2470 - Spacing between grid lines does not stay at 1px ...... as I would like it to.Use GimpSpinButton, added in the previous commit, in GimpSizeEntry,instead of GtkSpinButton.  This avoids updating the spin-buttons'adjustment values when they lose focus, truncating the value if itcan't be accurately displayed using the corresponding spin-button'sdigit count.  Since size-entries can have multiple spin-buttonsusing different units, this prevents the value from changing whenentring a value using one unit, and then shifting the focus to, butnot changing, another unit.	4

app: log actions upon activation before emitting "selected" signalIn GimpAction, instead of connecting the action-history logfunction to the action's "activate" signal as a user-providedhandler, call it directly from the default handler.In subclasses of GimpAction, chain to the parent's activate()function before emitting the "selected" signal, so that we alwayslog the action in the history before responding to it.This allows us to avoid the hack in commit6544ce4301fa43636b4c282c7b4815e18fd653d1.	1

app: improve/fix the most-recently used layers stack management.A few issues existed in the code:- When the layers selection is changed, make sure we remove all  duplicates (not only the first one). This should not be a problem  anyway because we also do this duplication cleanup elsewhere now, but  still…- Fix gimp_image_layer_stack_cmp(): we were comparing a GList element to  the data of another, so we were actually never finding duplicates.- Add gimp_image_clean_layer_stack() for internal layers stack  management/cleanup. It takes care of recursively making sure we don't  leave duplicates, and remove all empty lists.- Now use this new cleanup function inside  gimp_image_remove_from_layer_stack() instead of doing some incomplete  and broken element removal. This was especially broken as we were  removing a GSList element from a list we were iterating on (so we were  dereferencing a now freed element). This last issue was reported by  Massimo, and this is how I found the more general failure in this  layers stack management.	0

Issue #3309: Translation of gimp installer for MS Windows.Several of our own translations of the Windows installer are unusedbecause Inno Setup corresponding translations are marked "unofficial".This mostly means that the language files for these are probably old andunmaintained, hence outdated. And these files are not bundled togetherwith Inno Setup release (though still hosted in their repo).Nevertheless it doesn't make sense that we would just waste the work ofour translators here. Maybe Inno Setup localization is not complete, sowhat? At best it could even encourage translators to contribute upstreamto Inno Setup. Let's just enable all our current localizations of theinstaller and see how it goes!	0

Bug 789613 - core: Fix integer overflow on 64 bit systemsThe C language only promotes data values up to (un)signed int,which is 32 bit, if no larger data type is used within thecalculation. Having a multiplication of two gint variables,even if the expected target variable is of type gsize (64 bit),leads to a possible integer overflow.This bug can be triggered in gimp_temp_buf_new, which is usedto allocate memory for given supplied dimensions and bytes perpixel. If triggered, less memory than needed is allocated andtherefore allows out of boundary accesses, either resulting inpossible code execution or information leakage.While at it, make sure that the supplied format can actually beresolved to a bytes per pixel value. If not, return NULL.Signed-off-by: Tobias Stoeckmann <tobias@stoeckmann.org>	0

gif: perform bounds checking for table entriestable is specified to have 2 x (1<<12) entries, this in turn is because tableentries are specified to be smaller than (1<<12). Therefore we need to checkthat each entry is within the specified range.Without this check, it's possible to induce a buffer overflow read, see ASANoutput below. However the value that we read is eventually clamped to asafe range before being returned, hence this overflow seems pretty useless:==10977==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: global-buffer-overflow on address 0x0000010a21c0 at pc 0x00000056187b bp 0x7ffec915c550 sp 0x7ffec915c548READ of size 4 at 0x0000010a21c0 thread T0    #0 0x56187a in LZWReadByte /home/ahunt/git/gimp/plug-ins/common/file-gif-load.c:913:19    #1 0x55fc4d in ReadImage /home/ahunt/git/gimp/plug-ins/common/file-gif-load.c:1183:15    #2 0x55e447 in load_image /home/ahunt/git/gimp/plug-ins/common/file-gif-load.c    #3 0x561ef0 in LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput /home/ahunt/git/gimp/plug-ins/common/file-gif-load_fuzzer.c:79:17    #4 0x460e44 in fuzzer::Fuzzer::ExecuteCallback(unsigned char const*, unsigned long) /home/abuild/rpmbuild/BUILD/llvm-12.0.0.src/build/../projects/compiler-rt/lib/fuzzer/FuzzerLoop.cpp:599:15    #5 0x46034a in fuzzer::Fuzzer::RunOne(unsigned char const*, unsigned long, bool, fuzzer::InputInfo*, bool, bool*) /home/abuild/rpmbuild/BUILD/llvm-12.0.0.src/build/../projects/compiler-rt/lib/fuzzer/FuzzerLoop.cpp:505:3    #6 0x462067 in fuzzer::Fuzzer::MutateAndTestOne() /home/abuild/rpmbuild/BUILD/llvm-12.0.0.src/build/../projects/compiler-rt/lib/fuzzer/FuzzerLoop.cpp:745:19    #7 0x462bf5 in fuzzer::Fuzzer::Loop(std::__Fuzzer::vector<fuzzer::SizedFile, fuzzer::fuzzer_allocator<fuzzer::SizedFile> >&) /home/abuild/rpmbuild/BUILD/llvm-12.0.0.src/build/../projects/compiler-rt/lib/fuzzer/FuzzerLoop.cpp:883:5    #8 0x450ea6 in fuzzer::FuzzerDriver(int*, char***, int (*)(unsigned char const*, unsigned long)) /home/abuild/rpmbuild/BUILD/llvm-12.0.0.src/build/../projects/compiler-rt/lib/fuzzer/FuzzerDriver.cpp:906:6    #9 0x47ae82 in main /home/abuild/rpmbuild/BUILD/llvm-12.0.0.src/build/../projects/compiler-rt/lib/fuzzer/FuzzerMain.cpp:20:10    #10 0x7f307beb4349 in __libc_start_main (/lib64/libc.so.6+0x24349)    #11 0x424259 in _start /home/abuild/rpmbuild/BUILD/glibc-2.26/csu/../sysdeps/x86_64/start.S:1200x0000010a21c0 is located 1088 bytes to the right of global variable 'table' defined in 'file-gif-load.c:794:15' (0x1099d80) of size 32768SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: global-buffer-overflow /home/ahunt/git/gimp/plug-ins/common/file-gif-load.c:913:19 in LZWReadByteShadow bytes around the buggy address:  0x00008020c3e0: f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9  0x00008020c3f0: f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9  0x00008020c400: f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9  0x00008020c410: f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9  0x00008020c420: f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9=>0x00008020c430: f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9[f9]f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9  0x00008020c440: f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9  0x00008020c450: f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9  0x00008020c460: f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9  0x00008020c470: f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9  0x00008020c480: f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9Shadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):  Addressable:           00  Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07  Heap left redzone:       fa  Freed heap region:       fd  Stack left redzone:      f1  Stack mid redzone:       f2  Stack right redzone:     f3  Stack after return:      f5  Stack use after scope:   f8  Global redzone:          f9  Global init order:       f6  Poisoned by user:        f7  Container overflow:      fc  Array cookie:            ac  Intra object redzone:    bb  ASan internal:           fe  Left alloca redzone:     ca  Right alloca redzone:    cb  Shadow gap:              cc==10977==ABORTING( crash-911d5feb07551dd0313d204db4883838139820f5 )	5

Note that the variousgimp_display_shell_render_foo() functions still speak inapplication pixels, and the scaling happens internally ingimp_display_shell_render().Aside from rendering at native resolution on HiDPI, this also fixesan issue where grid-like display artifacts would appear when therender cache was not fully validated due to the non-native scaling.	5

plug-ins: ico export crashes on indexed images.It seems the current code simply forgot to break on indexed types andtherefore hit some g_return_*if_reached() code breaking the logics.Looking further, I see some code taking care of indexed images andconverting them to RGB. And testing after adding breaks looks like itworks just fine.So I am assuming this was just forgotten breaks indeed, and not onpurpose not allowing indexed images (if that were the intent though,this is not how it should be done).	1

Implemented an image pyramid for the GimpProjection. An image pyramid2007-06-06  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>Implemented an image pyramid for the GimpProjection. An image pyramidcaches a projection at several sizes, causing the rendering code not tohave to swap in all tiles of a (potentially) large image; it can usesmall versions of the projection if the user is zoomed out.The image pyramid also imroves visual quality, especially at zoom levelswhere there is a pyramid level that matches perfectly (i.e. at e.g. 50%,25%, and 12.5% zoom). A step on the right track for bug #76096.* app/core/gimpprojection.[ch]: Adjusted to make use of an imagepyramid. GimpProjection now keeps an array of TileManager:s, one perpyramid level.

Bug 751333 - Crash when moving cursor with ibus "Hangul" input method...... and improve input method UI. IM should not use some floating overlayframe to display the preedit text. Instead it is now directly insertedinto the text tool box, as selected text. It permits redimensionning ofthe text box while typing, and push the rest of the text when insertingin the middle (instead of superimposing an overlay box over the currenttext box, making everything unreadable).Input methods still have a few more issues, but this fixes the main UIweirdness as well as the crash with Hangul IM.	0

plug-ins: partly port file-raw-data to newer dialog generation API.Only port the export dialog so far. We'll see later for the load dialog.This uses the new gimp_procedure_dialog_get_int_radio().While doing this, I also better name "Image type" to "Planarconfiguration", which is how DICOM standard and TIFF call the sameoption. Within this settings, "Standard" is renamed "Contiguous" as amore correct naming than a very vague "standard".Similarly I rename "Palette type" to "Palette's configuration".This is a first step to make RAW export clearer in the path of fixingissue #7091.	0

gitlab-ci: new build organization.Rather than having the whole Win32 cross-build into the 'gimp' stage,break the dependencies and GIMP-only builds in 2 stages.Since apparently we need to keep the same structure for the native andcross build (otherwise we don't get parallel builds; in other words, Ididn't find the possibility to set separate pipelines up), I move babland GEGL into the same 'dependencies' stage.Finally I remove the -base rules extended into actual jobs, except for`.gimp-base` (this is the only which makes sense as it is actuallycommon to the meson and autotools build).	1
devel-docs: add a "removed functions" table with replacement proposal.Let's start up some porting guide for plug-in developers.

app: make the alpha channel work on canvas overlay widgets* app/widgets/gimpoverlaychild.c: when creating offscreen windows, try  to set an RGBA colormap on the offscreen window's widget and use the  RGBA colormap to create the window. This has to be done here,  because it's not possible to get to the right screen *inside* the  offscreen widget before it's parented, and we need that screen  before the widget is realized, and the widget can't be parented  before it's realized or it will get the wrong parent window.  Everything clear now?* app/widgets/gimpoverlayframe.c: draw the round corners only if the  screen has an RGBA colormap.	2
app: cancel the active tool before going brightness/contrast->levels->curvesbecause changing tools now automatically commits the old tool.	4

script-fu: fix #6741 Round Corners script fails to work on layer masksThe round corners script was assuming that the drawable alwayswas a layer, which is incorrect when a layer mask is selected.We fix this by always requesting the active layer instead ofactive drawable.We also enable this script for RGB and GRAY with alphachannel. Although it might not always make sense touse this script when an alpha channel is present, therecan be use cases where it is perfectly fine.So let the designer decide if this script is suited or notinstead of GIMP making that judgement.	1

app, libgimpwidgets: drop the thumbnail icon feature.From years of discussions, it turns out that:- The thumbnailed-Wilber icon replacing the generic icon of GIMP often  makes the application harder to spot in the icon list of running  processes.- In single-window mode in particular, it makes even less sense as we  just show the one active image anyway.- Even in multi-window mode, nowadays many OSes or desktop group windows  of a same application under one icon. So we end up with several image  windows under a thumbnail only showing the top image. This happens in  KDE, GNOME, Cinnamon and Windows at least apparently (as far as is  being reported).- Some platforms would just use only the OS-declared icon and not care  about runtime-declared ones. This is apparently the case on macOS, and  also on GNOME when the desktop file is seen by the desktop  environment. So all our code about generating thumbnailed icon is  wasted on these platform anyway.- When intensively testing the current behavior, I had cases when the  icon was not properly updated. We could of course investigate and fix  the issues, but considering all the previous points, it might make  more sense to simply drop the feature which is mostly useless, or  worse bothersome, hence simplify the code greatly.- Finally API to set icons from GdkPixbuf data has been removed in GTK4.  So long term, trying to keep this whole machinery feels like just  making our life difficult for a feature which all OSes seem to  deprecate and which might not be possible anymore soon (or just get  harder and harder to implement).Note that I don't use gtk_window_set_default_icon_name() because itwould use the icon from our theme, yet so far we are not sure it makessense for the application icon which we probably always want to be thesame, whatever the chosen theme. Finally I just list various common iconsizes because GTK API doesn't seem to be clever enough yet. I can't justgive it 1 SVG image (e.g. with gtk_window_set_default_icon_from_file())and hope it does the resizing at the last minute. It turns out itdoesn't and we get an extra-small icon. So instead, let's generatecommon sizes ourselves from the same SVG.	1

app, tools: allow creating demo "scenarios" from the AppStream metadata.The idea is to add some "demo" attribute to a list item inside the<release> tag, since we already decided that (for now at least) we'dkeep a strict "intro + list" logics, as we did until now.This demo attribute uses an internal format to specify successivewidgets to blink (like a demo path towards a feature). For now, what itallows is:* raise the toolbox, select a tool and blink the tool button.* raise a dockable, blink any widgets in there.Now it is still limited and needs to evolve. In particular:* What happens if the blinked tool button was explicitly removed from  Preferences? Should we re-add it for the demo? And once done, should  we remove it again? Then should we select back the tool previously  selected?* What happens if the dockable widget is not visible? Should we allow  changing the settings to be able to demo correctly the new/changed  settings? Should it be temporary? If temporary, it can be annoying as  you'd still have to look attentively the demo to find back the path to  the new settings. If not temporary, some people may dislike we touch  their settings.* What if docks are hidden? Should we unhide them, then hide them back  after demo time?Also regarding the implementation: originally I wanted to just grab thedemo attribute directly from the AppStream metadata file, but I realizedthat appstream-glib cleans out unknown attribute from the XML. I couldthen simply parse the file with a generic XML parser, but I foundsimpler to pre-parse it into a header built within GIMP. I still useappstream-glib at runtime as it takes care of localization for us(though in the same time, we also have the localization in the main pofiles, so maybe we could just embed the release note strings as well).See appstream-glib report: https://github.com/hughsie/appstream-glib/issues/431	0

plug-ins: multi-layer support in PSD load/export.- Store the Layer ID (lyid) block. Use GIMP's layer tattoo as a PSD  layer ID, hence mirroring PSD load processing (we were already reading  this block into our layer tattoos but always exporting with no ID).- Add support for the Layer Selection ID(s) block (0x042D) both on  import and export in order to store and restore the multi-layer  selection.  We were previously using the Layer state information block (0x0400) to  store the active layer, but it doesn't seem to be usable for multiple  layer selection. Actually it is even doubtful if this was working fine  even for single layer selection but I can't be sure (I could only test  in non-Photoshop software available to me). So the new logics is:  * If more than 1 layer is selected, store only the Layer Selection    ID(s) block.  * If exactly 1 layer is selected, store both the Layer Selection ID(s)    and Layer state information blocks.  * Otherwise (no layers selected) do not store any of these blocks.	5

Bug 780270 - MinGW build fail on Windows (broken m4 macro).BUILD_EXEEXT was not properly set (config macro AX_PROG_CC_FOR_BUILD).Apparently we need aclocal/automake version 1.13 or higher and todistribute ax_prog_cc_for_build.m4 ourselves to benefit from a fixreleased only in autoconf 2.69.Thanks to Éric Hoffman for reporting and investigating on this.Automake 1.13 apparently dates from 2012 and debian testing providesa newer version (automake 1.15) so it should be ok to update it. Alsothat's only a build dependency.	5

app: allow moving an intersecting pair of guides with the Move toolThis commit adds support for moving together an intersecting pairof guides using the Move tool, by dragging the guides at theirpoint of intersection.  This is useful when the guides are used tomark a point, rather than a pair of lines (e.g., as is the case forthe mandala symmetry guides, which mark the symmetry's point oforigin).Add gimp_image_pick_guides(), which can return a set of guides,rather than a single guide.  The API allows an arbitrary set ofguides to be returned, but, in practice, at most two intersectingguides are returned, as per the above.In GimpMoveTool and GimpGuideTool, add support for moving multipleguides together, and, in GimpMoveTool, use gimp_image_pick_guides()to potentially pick multiple guides.	1

In particular, raw_load_gray_8_plus() is nowremoved as raw_load_standard() will handle all full-bytes use caseswhere the input and output formats have the same components in sameorder.Also RAW_RGB and RAW_RGBA are renamed to RAW_RGB_8BPP and RAW_RGBA_8BPPrespectively.	1

app: improve file magic matchingChange file magic matching from using a simple boolean "magic matches"logic to using a matching quality. The quality is measured by thenumber of bytes that matched.Matching a single file procedure's magics now tries all magics andreturns the best match quality.Searching a file procedure for a given file now tries all fileprocedures and returns the one with the best match quality.This fixes raw camera files being opened as TIFF, given a better magicthan just the generic TIFF magic is provided.	1
gitlab-ci: store flatpak-build output into a log file.Without this, the flatpak build is just too long and Gitlab CI juststops logging it. So we end up with a log saying the quite useless (atthe end):> Job's log exceeded limit of 16777216 bytes.> Job execution will continue but no more output will be collected.We don't even reach babl/GEGL/GIMP builds, which are the most important.With this little trick, I am redirecting output to a log file and simplyincluding said log into the artifacts, hence allowing to debug the fullbuild.	0

app, tools: use the new gimp_print_stack_trace() to output the...... stacktrace into a file on non-Win32 systems.This has a few advantages:- First, we don't need to duplicate stacktrace code inside the  independent gimp-debug-tool (I even noticed that the version in the  tool was gdb-only and not updated for lldb fallback; proof that code  duplication is evil!). Instead, even on a crash, we can create the  stacktrace from the main binary and simply pass it as a file.- Secondly, that allows to fallback to the backtrace() API even for  crashes (this was not possible if the backtrace was done from a  completely different process). That's nice because this makes that we  will always get backtraces in Linux (even though backtrace() API is  not as nice as gdb/lldb, it's better than nothing).- Finally this makes the code smaller (i.e. easier to maintain), more  consistent and similar on all platforms.	1

meson: make run_command() calls future-proof.Some of our calls to run_command() would have failed with futureversions of meson if we didn't set the "check" parameter. In particular,in various calls, we don't want to fail the whole build configurationwhen the command does (as it's an optional feature check). In such acase, it is important to be explicit as future will default to failthen.Fixes:> WARNING: You should add the boolean check kwarg to the run_command call.>          It currently defaults to false,>          but it will default to true in future releases of meson.>          See also: https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/issues/9300	0

build, gitlab-ci: add a script to cross-build GIMP with Gitlab CI.It looks like Arch does not have mingw64 cross-compilers in core packagerepository. It does have some package in the user repository (AUR), butI assume that such a repository cannot be deemed as safe.Anyway I still tried, but apparently these AUR packages have to be builtand when I tried, I got this error:>  ERROR: Running makepkg as root is not allowed as it can cause> permanent, catastrophic damage to your system.Anyway it's all a big mess. Then I tried to move the cross-CI to Debiantesting, which is anyway our base compatibility system. Unfortunately Iencountered like what looked like some glibc++ macro problem on somepackages (most likely because the pre-built packages I use are Fedoraones which likely uses a cross-compiler differently built from theDebian one).So in the end, for simplicity, I use a Fedora image, then I am sure toget a good match between the system cross-compiler and the pre-builtdependencies.	5

app: implement gimp_symmetry_get_operation() in terms of gimp_symmetry_get_matrix()Remove the GimpSymmetry::get_operation() virtual function, andinstead implement gimp_symmetry_get_operation() by returning anappropriate gegl:transform node based on the matrix returned bygimp_symmetry_get_matrix().  The returned node is owned by thecaller; since we no longer use the node's identity for cachingtrnasformed brushes, we no longer cache the transformation nodes.Remove the function's paint_width and paint_height parameters, andinstead return a transformation that should be applied at thecenter of the brush.  This simplifies the application of thetransformation in the Clone and Heal tools, as per the next commit.Remove the implementation of GimpSymmetry::get_operation() from allits subclasses, which should now only implementGimpSymmetry::get_transform().	1

Issue #7907: work around possible outdated data in meson tarball.`meson dist` don't imply a reconfigure or a rebuild which is actuallynot great as it means a wrong order of commands may create tarballs withoutdated data (typically: build, then pull new code, then dist).Of course for our official tarballs, it should be fine as we don'tgenerate tarballs manually anymore, but through the CI. Yet, just to beon the safe side, force-trigger a reconfigure then a build (which wouldlikely be very fast anyway in the common use case where we just did abuild right before).Additionally the INSTALL.in file is not copied anymore in the tarballand INSTALL will only be generated in git repositories.	2

Bug 783680 - Allow to hide color models in GimpColorScalesRedo the entire thing again:- Rename the values of enum GimpColorSelectorModel to include "MODEL"- Change GimpColorSelector API from set_model() to set_model_visible()  so visibility of each model can be toggled individually and is not  exclusive any longer- The GUI is back to what it was before, except that the "GIMP" page  now honors the model visibility and has a resonable minimum height	5

Bug 767873 - (CVE-2016-4994) Multiple Use-After-Free when parsing......XCF channel and layer propertiesThe properties PROP_ACTIVE_LAYER, PROP_FLOATING_SELECTION,PROP_ACTIVE_CHANNEL saves the current object pointer the @infostructure. Others like PROP_SELECTION (for channel) andPROP_GROUP_ITEM (for layer) will delete the current object and createa new object, leaving the pointers in @info invalid (dangling).Therefore, if a property from the first type will come before thesecond, the result will be an UaF in the last lines of xcf_load_image(when it actually using the pointers from @info).I wasn't able to exploit this bug because thatg_object_instance->c_class gets cleared by the last g_object_unref andGIMP_IS_{LAYER,CHANNEL} detects that and return FALSE.	1

Issue #1668 - Smudge Tool - Wrong colors when painting on an image ...... with a color profile other than the gimp built-in.Remove the separate alpha-channel copy ingimp_image_color_profile_srgb_to_pixel().  We no longer need it,since GimpColorTransform already takes care of that itself.We used babl_process() to copy the alpha, which would alsotransform the input color from R'G'B' to the output color space.When the same buffer was used for both input and output, this callwould overwrite the input to the subsequentgimp_color_transform_process_pixels() call; when the output colorspace was different than R'G'B', this meant we'd pass the input togimp_color_transform_process_pixels() in the wrong color space,producing wrong results.  This was the case when converting theforeground color for use with the smudge tool.	1

file-ps: GEGL convert gray and rgb save functions	1
app: more responsive lock and link popovers.First of all, let's use gtk_widget_show|hide() instead ofgtk_popover_popup|down() because these GtkPopover API sometimes "block"when clicking very fast on the item list, sometimes up to 2 or 3 seconds(at least it feels like seconds, I haven't actually timed it!). I'm surethe ones who developed it thought it was nice to have slow poppingdialogs, but when working fast, this can only be frustrating).The second responsiveness change is that when clicking out of usefullock popover area, it should not only close, but the event should bepassed onto the item tree view when relevant. This allows for instanceto directly click on an eye cell to change a layer visibility withouthaving to click twice.	4

GIR: Try to return more specific GtkWidget subclassIn GTK, a common scheme is to let a function creating a specific widgetto return a `GtkWidget *`, rather than the specific subtype, since youoften need to call API of GtkWidget, avoiding some useless casts.For bindings however (and especially bindings to compiled languages),this is a bit annoying, as you have to explicitly change the type of thereturn value (downcast), which is not trivial (or at least desirable) ineach language.Luckily, we can use `(type ...)` annotation for this use case, leavingthe C API unchanged, while improving the experience for bindings.	1

Issue #4871: Plug-ins not translated.Revert "app: also localize LC_TIME to GUI language."This reverts commit a4e65ac83668fdea7f58efe8c0bfaec535f6bb8b.LC_TIME format apparently does not accept the broader format with justthe lang part, for instance "fr". The region is necessary, like "fr_FR".In our supported languages, we were mostly using lang only except for afew langs where we support regional variants.This makes sense as time format may be quite different depending onregions (dates are quite different in GB vs US, though that was actuallyone of the cases where we were using accurate locale format).And the main issue is that it was not only breaking time localization.Normal string localization (LANGUAGE) got somehow broken as well bybroken LC_TIME.Anyway for now let's just stick to whatever OS-set time format (eventhough it may differ from GIMP Preferences-set language defaults).	1

fix nasty bug where if overwriting a file and also changing the format,Fri Aug 18 18:14:35 BST 2000 Austin Donnelly <austin@gimp.org>* app/fileops.c: fix nasty bug where if overwriting a file and    also changing the format, gimp would use the old format        rather than the newly selected one.  To repeat: save a new        image as (eg) jpeg by typing foo.jpg<RET>, then Save As XCF by        using the pop-up menu and clicking OK, then Save As jpeg by        using pop-up and clicking OK, and OK again to allow the file        to be overwritten.  You should find that foo.jpg contains an        XCF version of the image.  This was because the "overwrite"        path through the code was subtly different from the standard        way through, meaning that gimage_set_save_proc() was never        called.  Now unified into new function file_save_with_proc().	2

m4macros, plug-ins: run more accurately the "python2" interpreter.Our configure test checks the presence of a Python2, but then uses"python" as interpreter, which is a problem nowadays as the defaultpython is set to be Python 3 on some distributions (and this will bemore and more the case). So GIMP may end up trying to run our plug-insthrough Python 3 (which would fail) even if Python 2 is present.Now AM_PATH_PYTHON2() m4 macro will set $PYTHON to a more accuratePython version as priority.Similarly let's use "python2" in the binfmt string for extension search.(cherry picked from commit 03ea9cac540b197a5b0eb11a40909c30330d90e5)	5

app: some signal handling/updating fixes that also make undo mostly work- most importantly, when the text changes and we set the buffer (as  happens when undoing), block the "changed" signal on the *buffer*  and not on the proxy (which doesn't even have a "changed"  signal). This was apparently something that happened during the  on-canvas editor merging.- don't update the proxy when the layout changes, that's the wrong way  around. Instead, update the layout whenever the proxy changes,  remove lots of calls to update_layout() from the text editor and let  the "changed" callback on the buffer do its job of updating  everything.	5

Issue #2275: rotate commands not actually applied to the image.The rotation was actually applied but the image had an orientationmetadata stored which is not visible in GIMP canvas (only checked atimport).If GIMP had on-canvas viewing support of the orientation metadata, thenit would make sense to keep it between import and export, but since itdoesn't, we should assume that when someone asks to "Keep Original"during import, they are actually asking to drop the metadata (whichactually can be wrong in various cases, in particular when you snappictures of the ground or the sky, then sensors are lost anyway andregularly can't guess what orientation you wanted). This will make forless unexpected exports.	1

libgimp: s/gimp_image_new_by_id()/gimp_image_get_by_id()/This means that images' ownership is not given to caller in particular.libgimp will now keep a reference of all GimpImage-s it creates andreturn this same reference if called again.

devel-docs: we must still restart a plug-in to debug with SIGCONT.Commit 59f2ba44c7 changed the devel docs to tell that on Linux, justrunning the gdb command `continue` is enough to restart the plug-inprocess. Maybe it is true on some specific setups, so I leave this partof the note, but for sure it never worked for me. I may run `continue`as many times as I want, the process stays stopped until I explicitlysend a SIGCONT signal (our code raises itself a SIGSTOP which requires aSIGCONT for continuation of the process).Maybe in some configurations, gdb actually sends a SIGCONT when`continue` is run but not in others? No idea.Anyway I add back the part about sending a SIGCONT too, then people cantest and choose which procedure works for them.	1

plug-ins: fix #8553 GIMP 2.99.12 Cannot Open WebP FilesGIMP tried to open webp files as ani (animated cursor) files. The reasonfor this is that for ani we had set the file magic as the first 4 bytesshould be RIFF.However, RIFF is a container format, used by many different file formats,among which is also webp.This means that checking for RIFF is not specific enough.Based on the info on http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/ANIwe will check the 4 bytes starting at offset 8 for ACON, which isapparently the identifying part for animated icons.	1

Bug 676522 - Make DND work between images in *one* dockable......after in-DND image switchingThis was actually two issues:First, DND data is normally transferred on drop. In this situation thecontents of the source widget change in the middle of DND, so when thedrop happens there is nothing to transfer. Fixed this by attaching thething to transfer (image, item, color etc) to the GdkDragContext whenthe DND operation starts, and trying to retrieve it on drop. Only whennothing is attached we fall back to the traditional way of asking thesource widget. This is expected and an obvious fix.Second, and not so obvious, the source part of the GTK+-internal stateof the DND operation (GtkDragSourceInfo) contains a *reference* (not acopy) of the source widget's target list. When we change images in themiddle of DND, the source layer view's target list gets modified, andbecause GtkDragSourceInfo only references it, the state of the ongoingDND operation gets destroyed with it. Fixed this by changinggimp_dnd_data_source_remove() to never change a source widget's targetlist but instead create a new list without the removed target andreplace the source widget's list, keeping the ongoing drag's listunaffected.Also kept all the GIMP_LOG() stuff I added during debugging there, itturned out to be quite useful.	1

app: improve Measure Tool digit precision.When working with high resolution, you may have cases where measuredlength won't be displayed with enough digits; i.e. several pixels lengthwould show up as 0. For instance at 4000 PPI, up to 7 pixels show up as0 mm, then at 0.1 mm from the 8th pixel (actually reaching over 0.05 mm,approximating as 0.1), then 0.2 at 24 pixels (actually: 0.152), and soon. At such a resolution, 3 digits are needed for 'mm' instead of the1 digit returned by gimp_unit_get_digits() so that we display reliablelengths.Therefore we need to compute ideal digit precision. Configured digitsfor a given unit will now be used as a minimum value, but actually useddigits may be higher.	1

app: use gimp_tile_handler_validate_validate() in gimp:buffer-source-validateUse gimp_tile_handler_validate_validate(), added in the commitbefore last, in gimp:buffer-source-validate, in order to pre-renderthe necessary region of the buffer, instead of performing thevalidation implicitly by iterating over the region.  This is bothsimpler, and, more importantly, allows us to render the entireregion in a single chunk, instead of tile-by-tile, which can beconsiderably more efficient, especially with high thread counts.This essentially extends the dynamic sizing of rendered projectionchunks to layer groups, which are rendered throughgimp:buffer-source-validate, rather than just the main imageprojection.	5

app, pdb: properly save the list of source drawables.By doing this, I also add the ability to use a composited projection ofthe selected drawables as source.

This ability works forcloning from multiple layers to one.	1

plug-ins: various fixes and nitpicking to file-webp.- get_preset_from_id() was defined in file-webp-dialog.c but used in  file-webp.c only. Move it there.- Make the preset list available in file-webp-save.h header (since it  is specifically an encoder attribute) as static, because it is used  both in the dialog ("preset" choice list) and the main file (for match  of the "preset" parameter as internal ID to a WebPPreset when run as  non-interactive).- Generate the "preset" parameter description from the preset list.  This way, even if this list were to change (in some hypothetical  future), the description (and in particular the list of possible  values and their int match) won't end up wrong.- "enum WebPPreset" is typedef-ed to "WebPPreset".- Use G_N_ELEMENTS to compute length of arrays on the stack (equivalent  to the current code but shorter and simpler to read).- Many formatting fixes.	0

app: don't sync Blend tool's gradient-repeat property with gimp:blend...... when gradient_type >= GIMP_GRADIENT_SHAPEBURST_ANGULAR.Our current GUI code for the Blend tool options disables the "Repeat"widget with any of the shaped and spiral gradient types, which means (Iassume) no repeat mode is allowed on these gradients. Nevertheless itwas possible to change the repeat mode in another gradient type, thenswitch to one of these and get the repeat processed even though the GUIshows insensitive.I could simply reset the repeat mode to GIMP_REPEAT_NONE when settingone of these gradient types, but I think you'd want the repeat to stayat its value (being insensitive is enough to mean whatever value is setis not taken into account). So instead, I just unsync this specificproperty when appropriate.Note also I don't do this in the gimp:blend operation code because I amnot sure this specific behavior is meant to be a generic blend behavioror just relative to the tool (render of the shaped gradients is barelydifferent with a repeat, but there is still a difference).	1

Issue #3990: make the status of the XCF docs a bit clearer (hopefully).Though it may have started as an unofficial document, it is clearly nowan official one (which should be obvious since it is in our sourcerepository, but apparently some people get misled by the historical"Status" text to think this to be somehow unofficial).So first of all, change the s/official/unofficial/ mention.Secondly, add a small paragraph explicitly telling that the document iscomplete (and meant to be), to the best of our knowledge. This documentis a detailed, full and exhaustive written "specification" of the XCFformat up to GIMP 2.10.x (even though the normative spec is still thecode itself). Now we are humans, we may have missed something, and ifso, this is just to be considered as any other bug, and reported to usnicely to be fixed.	0

Issue #8124: plug-in localization now totally moved plug-in side.Plug-in localization was always partially plug-in side, especially forthings like custom GUI. But labels or blurb in GIMP (such as in menus oraction search) were localizing GIMP side.It had many drawbacks:- To get menu localization, a plug-in had to set up gettext, even though  they might want to use something else for their GUI (after all, giving  facilities for gettext is a good idea, but there is no reason to force  using this system).- There was a complex internal system passing the localization domain  name, as well as the catalog file system path to core, then through  various classes which we can now get rid of.- There could be domain name clashes, if 2 plug-ins were to use the same  i18n domain name. This was handled in now removed functions  gimp_plug_in_manager_get_locale_domains() by simply keeping a unique  one (and gimp_plug_in_manager_bind_text_domains() would just bind the  domain to the kept directory). In other words, one of the duplicate  plug-ins would use the wrong catalog. We could try to make the whole  thing more complicated or try to forbid plug-ins to use any random  name (in particular made easier with the new extension wrapper). But  anyway this whole issue doesn't happen anymore if localization is  fully made plug-in side, so why bother?I tried to evaluate the advantages of the core-side localization ofplug-in labels/blurbs and could only find one theoretical: if we wantedto keep access to the original English text. This could be useful(theoretically) if we wanted to search (e.g. in the action search) inboth localized and English text; or if we wanted to be able to swapeasily en/l10n text in a UI without reload. But even if we were to everdo this, it would only be possible for plug-ins (GEGL operations inparticular are localized GEGL-side), so it lacks consistency. And it'sunsure why special-casing English should really make sense for otherlanguage natives who want text in their lang, and search in their lang.They don't necessarily care about original.So in the end, I decided to simplify the whole thing, make localizationof plug-ins a plug-in side thing. Core will only receive translated textand that's it. It cuts a lot of code out of the core, simplify runtimeprocessing and make plug-in creation simpler to understand.The only think I still want to look at is how exactly menu paths aretranslated right now. Note that it still works, but it's possible thatsome things may be worth improving/simplifying on this side too.	1
app: GTK+3 has more GdkAxisUse values.This fixes a crash when we were looping until GDK_AXIS_LAST, but ourexisting code was expecting less values.Also I note that GTK+3 has an additional GDK_AXIS_ROTATION since version3.22, even though we were told that some pens with rotation supportwould report rotation values with same valuator as for the wheel (atleast, the Wacom Art Pen would apparently use the same 6th valuator).For proper support, it would be really worth testing such pens.	3

Bug 694417 - GIMP Segmentation Faults (Segfault, Crash) after Changing Color...Don't pass a NULL pointer to gimp_text_buffer_get_font_tag() becauseit is dereferenced in a call to strcmp().gimp_context_get_font_name() returns NULL when the selected textincludes spans with different fonts.

app: proper ellipsis & wrap on Image Properties label where it matters.The color space label may be a bit long (depends on profile title whichmay just be anything and we don't control it), so I allow it to wrap.The file path on the other hand would not work well with wrapping. Italready has ellipsis in center, but GTK always gives the max size it canas a default. So if the file is even just slightly deep in the filetree, we end up with extra-wide Image Properties dialog.My trick is to give a sensible max size at dialog creation (25characters max) but to disable this max size as soon as the window getsrealized, hence allowing the label to actually grow up to the contentsactual max size, were one to manually resize the window.	1

xcf: fix #6138 Stack Overflow when saving xcf.Although I haven't been able to reproduce it, it is apparentlypossible to get a Stack Overflow when loading xcf files withpresumably very large dimensions on Windows. From whatI'm reading Windows normally has a smaller stack size thanLinux, probably why it hasn't surfaced there.Instead of allocating on the stack let's do a g_malloc0combined with g_free.	2

app: implement second step for line art selection/filling.When filling colors in line arts, you don't want to leave space betweenthe strokes and the color, which usually happen with any of the currentselection methods.A "KISS" trick is usually to grow your selection a few pixels beforefilling (adding an additional step in colorization process), whichobviously does not handle all cases (depending on drawing style andstroke size, you may need to grow more or less) as it doesn't take intoaccount actual stroke geometry.Instead, I label the selection and the "rest" differently and leave thepixel strokes unlabelled. Then I let these unlabelled pixels be floodedby the "gegl:watershed-transform" operation.Note that this second step is different from the second step from theGREYC research paper, as they use their own watershed algorithm takingcolor spots as sources to color the whole image at once. This is adifferent workflow from the one using bucket fill with a single colorsource.	1

app: new double action "tools-mypaint-brush-pixel-size-set", used as…… new action_pixel_size of GimpMyBrushTool.MyPaint brush tool clearly shows the limits of my trick to have someenum actions work with absolute values whereas others work withper-mille values between the property min and max.Indeed firstly MyBrush's "radius" value is logarithmic and can benegative. Since the enum trick relies on the fact that negative valuesare the semantic enumerated constants, it's broken in such case. Thesecond issue is that while it was acceptable to use int size for mostpaint tools (even though they were double), here radius only goes from-2.0 to 6.0; so using int values only would leave us with jumping brushsizes.So now I create a proper double action which simply takes pixel size anduse this from the on-canvas brush size changing. No weird trick, no intor sign limitations.I also add a new optional action_pixel_size in GimpToolControl.Note: I'm also updating a bit the logic for the MyPaint brush outlinefunction gimp_mybrush_tool_get_outline(). Indeed after skimming a bitthrough mypaint-brush.c code in libmypaint, I am not sure at all we needto use the offset_by_random like this. And really this shown outlineseems more indicative than anything else when I see the actual sizeprinted by the various brushes. Finally here it was counter-productiveas I needed to get easily the logarithmic radius from the pointerinteraction on canvas.	2

libgimpbase: fix #1350 Failure to load metadata importing image with non-latin unicode pathOn Windows loading metadata from images with non ASCII characters in theirpath failed. Part of the fix is in gexiv2 that now converts the path fromutf-8 to utf-16 on Windows.However we were still sending a localized path to gexiv2 where it wasexpecting utf-8. This caused the conversion and thus loading of metadatato fail. Fix is to remove the special handling for Windows and use theutf-8 filename.	2

build: add lua support to the Windows installer.Note that I must not install both lua51 with luajit because these areconflicting. Let's go with luajit from feedback we had on the bestchoice (though this topic itself seems a bit heated actually).Also clean-out the unexpected file removal because now I had theopposite case, i.e. a CI problem because of this. And from my latesttests, it seems to work ok for the time being without, which is muchcleaner anyway. So let's go like this for the time being.	4

app: Smoother zooming while dragging with the mouseChanges the behavior of gimp_display_shell_scale_drag() to factor in the distance dragged, rather than just scaling a flat +/- 10% for each detected movement event. The factor by which to change the scaling is also altered from 10% at each movement event, to 1% compounded for each pixel of distance dragged.  This makes zooming via Ctrl + Middle Click or Ctrl + Spacebar behave more consistently and less jittery versus the previous method, while offering more fine grained control.	1
