app: make update detection more robust to string revision field.The "revision" field in the json file is supposed to be int. But I justrealized that it was set as string a few times, e.g. in Windowsinstaller revision 1 of GIMP 2.10.32. As a consequence, the revision 0build was not able to detect the new revision.I have now fixed the data in gimp-web repo (commit e7690e36), yet justin case this ever happens again, I make the parsing code more robust byaccepting string revision, then properly converted to int.	1

app, pdb: set string arguments to "" *after* the GFile.Thanks to Wormnest for pushing me to look further. Since gimp-file-saveis actually redirecting the call to another procedure (save proc for thespecific format) which might have more arguments, including stringarguments. When it finds any, it sets it to an empty string "" (which Iguess is ok as "default value when we don't know what to put there").The previous code would not hurt. Starting at the fourth argument(GFile), it would just do nothing, then continue with the firth andfurther. Still, starting directly at the fifth arg is the proper codefor this.	2

plug-ins: add support for loading merged image data from PSD filesPSD files may include a "merged", pre-composited, version of theimage (in Photoshop, this is the case when saving files with"Maximize Compatibility" enabled; GIMP always saves the mergedimage data in exported PSD files.)  This commit adds support forloading the merged image version from PSDs, instead of the fulllayer hierarchy.  This is useful when loading PSD files that usefeatures that we don't currently support, and therefore can'trender correctly, such as adjustment layers.When loading the merged image version, we avoid loading certainadditional data from the file, such as channels, paths, andguides, while still loading metadata, making this akin to loadingother "flat" image formats.This option is currently exposed as an additional file type("Photoshop image (merged)"), which has to be explicitly selectedfrom the file-type list when opening the image.	2

Issue #6257: Race condition bug in meson build.This is not a fix, only a workaround for the CI to at least not failrandomly, for the time being.Basically since meson is running parallel jobs, even when the buildfails because git-version.h doesn't exist yet, while a depending file isbeing built, it will still be built immediately after, despite thefailure. As a consequence, re-running `ninja` immediately after (i.e.running `ninja || ninja`) will make the second build work. If it doesn'tthen it's another issue which has to be fixed. But at least we workaround this known race condition in the meson build for the time being.It's very ugly, but better than current situation. :-/	1

If your canvas is zoomed inand the image is offset in the display and a new view is requestedthe Canvas in the new view is corrupted. This bug is also ingimp 1.0.x	0

app: no generic comment when no revision comment set.After discussing with Schumaml and Houz on IRC, let's just drop thegeneric comment which may be confusing and is probably unecessary,especially now that I write the revision number (present and new ones).So let's just assume people understand that they should update, evenwhen GIMP version stays the same (this was the case I was the most waryabout, that people think the notification is an error as since they havethe last version, they don't have to update GIMP).I hesitated to at least leave just the simple "It is recommended toupdate." sentence but after much hesitation, let's go with no genericcomment at all. The download button by itself should suffice.Of course, when a specific revision comment is set ingimp_versions.json, it is still displayed.	5

Also replace singleitem in various undo classes by GList of items.Also "active-*-changed" GimpImage signals are no more, fully replaced by"selected-*s-changed".This is still work-in-progress.	1

Bug 676566 - Window title becomes "Untitled" after exporting without savingFix this and other issues more globally by moving the logic thatformats the image's display name into the GimpImage object, and returnthe properly formatted name, e.g. "Foo.xcf", or "[Foo] (imported)"from gimp_image_get_display_name().Also add gimp_image_get_display_path() which returns the full pathinstead.

app: allow adding and removing sliders to/from a GimpToolLineAdd support for adding and removing sliders to/from a GimpToolLine,using three new signals:  - can-add-slider:  Takes a double argument in the range [0,1],    indicating a location along the line, and returns a boolean    value, indicating whether a slider can be added at that    location.  - add-slider:  Takes a double argument in the range [0,1],    indicating a location along the line, for which can-add-slider    returned TRUE.  In response, should add a new slider at that    location, and return its index, or a negative value if no    slider was added.  - remove-slider:  Takes a slider index.  In response, may remove    the slider.On the UI side, when the cursor is close enough to the line, butnot within the hit area of an existing handle, GimpToolLine checksif a slider can be added at the cursor position, using can-add-slider.  If a slider can be added, a dashed circle appears at thecursor position along the line, indicating where a slider will beadded.  The cursor is added by clicking, which emits an add-slidersignal; if the signal returns a slider index, the new slider isselected, and can be subsequently dragged.Removing a slider is done by either selecting the slider andpressing backspace (or delete, although we don't actually forwardit to the tool atm,) or by "tearing" the slider: when draggingthe slider, if the cursor is far enough from the liner, a dashedcircle appears around the slider, and releasing the mouse removesthe slider.	4

The test are renamed to something with "GIMP 2.6" toemphasize that the tests work with files that might as well have beenconstructed with GIMP 2.6. Also adjust the list of things that shouldbe tested, but that isn't tested yet.FWIW, using the GNU gcc gcov tool it can be seen that xcf-load.c nowhas a code coverage of 67.04% of 722 lines.	3

build: base both the dev and nightly builds off a BaseApp.Keeping all dependencies inside the main manifest is very annoyingbecause flatpak-builder will check them every time the package isrebuilt. Worse, sometimes the cache won't be hit (even though it shouldhave), resulting into a rebuild of many dependencies. I create a BaseAppbuild which is the recommended process (and not creating our own runtimebased on GNOME one's, as I first thought) which won't need to be builtas often as the main manifests. The other advantage is obviously thatthis BaseApp can be shared between the dev and nightly (and likely eventhe stable later) builds. I will only keep differences inside the mainmanifests (for instance lcms2 which requires a higher version on masterthan on the GNOME runtime and the last dev release).I also move webkitgtk as the first dependencies since it takes too longand flatpak uses a sequential dependency graph (so any change to apreviously listed dependency, even when actually unrelated, wastriggering a rebuild of webkitgtk!).Only remaining issue is that I don't manage yet to run the cleanup ofthe BaseApp at the end of the main manifests (for files needed forbuilding, but not at runtime).	1
Bug 651956: Text tool misremembers point size upon reloading fileWhen setting the unit of a property shared with a gimp_prop_size_entry,a conversion is applied to the corresponding size property (to preservesize_entry's ref-value), but the conversion risks to change the sizeproperty already updated.To update, at the same time, size and unit, it is better to start updatingsize_entry's unit in order to trigger the useless conversion on the stalesize.	1

app, libgimp, plug-ins: move Orientation metadata handling into core.Orientation is now handled by core code, just next to profile conversionhandling.One of the first consequence is that we don't need to have a non-GUIversion gimp_image_metadata_load_finish_batch() in libgimp, next to aGUI version of the gimp_image_metadata_load_finish() function inlibgimpui. This makes for simpler API.Also a plug-in which wishes to get access to the rotation dialogprovided by GIMP without loading ligimpui/GTK+ (for whatever reason)will still have the feature.The main advantage is that the "Don't ask me again" feature is nowhandled by a settings in `Preferences > Image Import & Export` as the"Metadata rotation policy". Until now it was saved as a global parasite,which made it virtually non-editable once you checked it once (no easyway to edit parasites except by scripts). So say you refused therotation once while checking "Don't ask again", and GIMP will foreverdiscard the rotation metadata without giving you a sane way to changeyour mind. Of course, I could have passed the settings to plug-insthrough the PDB, but I find it a lot better to simply handle suchsettings core-side.The dialog code is basically the same as an app/dialogs/ as it was inlibgimp, with the minor improvement that it now takes the scale ratiointo account (basically the maximum thumbnail size will be bigger onhigher density displays).Only downside of the move to the core is that this rotation dialog israised only when you open an image from the core, not as a PDB call. Soa plug-in which makes say a "file-jpeg-load" PDB call, even inINTERACTIVE run mode, won't have rotation processed. Note that this wasalready the same for embedded color profile conversion. This can bewanted or not. Anyway some additional libgimp calls might be of interestto explicitly call the core dialogs.	2

app: support saving/exporting with multi-selection.This commit just changes our saving API (i.e. the GimpSaveProcedureclass) to take an array of drawables as argument instead of a singledrawable.It actually doesn't matter much for exporting as the whole API seemsmore or less bogus there and all formats plug-ins mostly care onlywhether they will merge/flatten all visible layers (the selected onesdon't really matter) or if the format supports layers of some sort. Itmay be worth later strengthening a bit this whole logics, and maybeallow partial exports for instance.As for saving, it was not even looking at the passed GimpDrawable eitherand was simply re-querying the active layer anyway.Note that I don't implement the multi-selection saving in XCF yet inthis commit. I only updated the API. The reason is that the currentcommit won't be backportable to gimp-2-10 because it is an API break. Onthe other hand, the code to save multi-selection can still be backportedeven though the save() API will only pass a single drawable (as I saidanyway, this argument was mostly bogus until now, hence it doesn'tmatter much for 2.10 logics).	2

libgimpwidgets: Use Screenshot portal for pickingFreedesktop (XDG) portals are a collection of D-Bus APIs that workacross desktop environments, display servers and work withincontainerized applications, like Flatpak. The internal implementationcan then choose to implement these in such a way that takes into accountsecurity considerations, as well as making sure the user consents tocertain actions.One such portal is the `Screenshot` portal, which contains a`Screenshot()` method as well as `PickColor()`. We already use theformer for taking a screenshot, and this commit makes sure our colorpicker also makes use of the latter.By doing this, color picking is now possible on the major Waylandcompositors.(Honestly, we should remove DE-specific backends like that of KWin, tohave less variation on the possible results of a color pickingoperation).Fixes https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/issues/1074	0

app: do not use PATH_MAX and realpath() on macOS.See the comments in MR!424.Basically realpath relies on false assumptions (probably ones which usedto be true when the API got created) on the max size of a path. Actuallynowadays paths can be much bigger than what the macro advertizes or caneven be unbounded.The Linux version of realpath() allows the second parameter to be NULL,in which case it would allocate the buffer, exactly for this reason(written in the BUGS section on the man). Unfortunately this behavior isnot standardized in POSIX and the man from Apple I found does notindicate it will do this.So let's use g_canonicalize_filename() instead, which seems to do theright thing. Similarly use g_strdup_printf instead of g_snprintf().	1

libgimp: sink the floating references after adding them to hash table.Though the previous implementation worked fine on C plug-ins, I realizedit was problematic on bindings. In particular, the Python binding atleast was somehow freeing returned floating objects, unless assigned toa variable.For instance, the widget returned by the following code:> dialog.get_color_widget('color', True, GimpUi.ColorAreaType.FLAT)â¦ was freed by the PyGObject binding when it was floating, even though(transfer none) was set (hence telling the binding it should not freethe returned object). The workaround was to assign it to some variable,even though I was not planning to use it.Making sure all references are full fixes it.GObject docs also notes:> **Note**: Floating references are a C convenience API and should not> be used in modern GObject code. Language bindings in particular find> the concept highly problematic, as floating references are not> identifiable through annotations, and neither are deviations from the> floating reference behavior, like types that inherit from> GInitiallyUnowned and still return a full reference from> g_object_new().	1

app: in GimpCurveView, use relative motion when dragging pointIn GimpCurveView, when dragging an existing curve point, don'timmediately move the point to the cursor position uppon buttonpress, but rather move it relative to its current position as thecursor moves.  This allows selecting a point without moving it, andadjusting its position more easily.Additionally, when the cursor hovers above a point, or whendargging a point, have the coordinate indicator show the point'sposition, rather than the cursor's.	1
app: more accurate undo names.Don't just name all alpha-selection actions the same "Alpha toSelection". Have some more accurate naming like "Substract Alpha fromSelection", etc.Also improve the action names to make them more accurate as these namesare not only in menus anymore, but also in search actions (and we wantto avoid duplicate naming).	1

meson, configure, plug-ins: image/x-sun-raster is a supported MimeTypes.Also ".sun" is a possible (and common) file name extension for SunRaster images, according to various sources and samples I found (thesesamples with .sun extension also opened fine in GIMP, so it's not just asubvariant which we may not handle or something of the sort). This oneis not so important though as we also register magic bytes for detection(which is the proper way), but it can still be useful, mostly forexporting (as we will direct to the SunRaster plug-in if someone triedto export a file with .sun extension, since no other file format usesthis extension AFAICS).There is no functional change, I just had a look at this plug-in whilehandling !428 and realized this format was not present in the MimeTypelist (which is used to generate the desktop file, in order to haveproper mime types, not detection based on extension only, unlikeWindows in !428).	2

plug-ins: in file-psd, use SRC_OVER and RGB_PERCEPTUAL for all layersUse SRC_OVER, instead of SRC_ATOP, as the composite mode for alllayers (or use AUTO, when it results in SRC_OVER), to matchPhotoshop's behavior.  Use RGB_PERCEPTUAL as the blend and compositespace, instead of AUTO, whose interpretation depends on the specificlayer mode, to match Photoshop's behavior for RGB images.  Use NORMALmode, instead of NORMAL_LEGACY, with the above properties, for normallayers, for consistency with the other layer modes, which don't (and,indeed, can't) use the legacy modes.	1

plug-ins: assume RGB/RGBA for JPEG2000 without declared color space.It seems that the color space is not necessarily declared for a JPEG2000image. From tests, it looks like it especially happens with JPEG2000codestream (.j2c or .j2k). This variant is apparently mostly designed tobe embedded (from what I read), which may explain why the color space isnot always set (I assume the embedding format would have the color spaceinformation). Mostly a guess.	5

Basically currently openingindexed images is not made obvious and you can end up thinking GIMP isbroken as when you try to paint with a given FG or BG color, you may geta completely different color on the canvas. And it is not obvious torealize why. Now at least, the FG/BG color will tell you when the coloryou are trying to paint with is not within the accepted palette.	1

app: new concept of sets of layers stored in GimpImage.The eventual goal is to replace the "linked layers" concept, which iswhy I am using similar vocabulary. The point is that linked layers aremostly useless/redundant now with multiplie layer selection, except forone thing: they kind of serve like a way to "save" a selection of layers(to be moved/transformed together mostly). Apart from this, multipleselection is more powerful on any way. You can do much more thantransforming the layers together (you can reorganize them together,delete them, crop them and so on).Therefore this new feature is the way to fill the only weakness of layerselection: its ephemerality. Now we can save a given set of layers, noteven only one, but as many as we want, and under a meaningful name, forlater reuse.Moreover it will make layer-handling core code much simpler as wecurrently have 2 concepts of layer set: multiple selection and links.The new stored links are only a way to recreate multiple selections.More is to come, for instance right now, these are not stored in the XCFformat. Also it would be awesome to add logical operators (Shift forunion of layer sets, Ctrl for subtraction and Shift-Ctrl forintersection). And finally I was thinking about a way to select bypattern (regular expression? Shell-style glob patterns?) and even storethese patterns. So if you save a "Marmot .*" selection pattern, thenwhen you select it later, new layers matching this pattern will beincluded too (instead of fixed-in-time list of layers).	0

Instead added make targets to    create a man-page and a default gimprc that take care of building    gimpconfig-dump.    * app/config/gimpconfig-dump.c: started to work on the man-page    dump functionality.	1
Ported the layers, channels and paths dialogs from2004-10-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>Ported the layers, channels and paths dialogs fromgimp_editor_add_button() to gimp_editor_add_action_button(),removing a massive amount of duplicated code, sensitivity logicand confusing utility functions.* app/actions/channels-actions.c* app/actions/channels-commands.[ch]* app/actions/layers-actions.c* app/actions/layers-commands.[ch]* app/actions/vectors-actions.c* app/actions/vectors-commands.[ch]: added "foo-new-default"actions and callbacks which create items without a dialog,optionally using default values from a passed template. Removedall public utility function that were passed as function pointersto widget construtors. Added tooltips to all actions which are nowused for dialog buttons.* app/widgets/gimpeditor.c (gimp_editor_add_action_button):automatically create multi-line tooltips showing the modifiers forextended action buttons.

gimp/plug-ins/sample_colorize.c Sample Colorize was not colorizing. Author2000-02-05  Garry R. Osgood <gosgood@idt.net>* gimp/plug-ins/sample_colorize.cSample Colorize was not colorizing. Authormisused gimp_selection_bounds(); assumed that"selection is empty" indicator was thisfunction's return value [p_init_gdrw() line 2597]Caused the plugin to assume an active selectionwas in progress even when there wasn't. Usually,this precluded any kind of colorization.Sanity-checked the existence of widgets beforetheir passage to GTK.	4

app: remove GIMP_LAYER_MODE_FLAG_WANTS_LINEAR_DATA and friendsInstead, add a gimp_layer_mode_get_format() function, which takesthe layer mode, composite space, and blend space, and returns theI/O format.Currently, we always use the composite space format as the I/Oformat.  This simplifies gimp_composite_blend(), and gives uscomposite-space support for the "special" layer mode ops for free.	1

Made all brushes scalable from the tool options. So far only downscaling2006-11-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>Made all brushes scalable from the tool options. So far onlydownscaling is supported since we lack an algorithm for bitmapbrush upscaling. Addresses bug #65030.* app/paint/gimppaintoptions.[ch]: added "brush-scale" property.* app/paint/gimpbrushcore.[ch]: separate pressure logic from brushscaling logic and take paint_options->brush_scale into account.Added gimp_brush_core_create_bound_segs() which returns BoundSegsof the correctly scaled brush mask for the brush preview on thecanvas.* app/tools/gimpbrushtool.c: use gimp_brush_core_create_bound_segs()instead of doing this here (also removes all knowledge about lowlevelstuff from this file).

app: move bottom-layer special casing to GimpOperationLayerModeGimpFilter's is_last_node field only reflects the item's positionwithin the parent stack.  When a layer is contained in a pass-through group, it can be the last layer of the group, while notbeing the last layer in the graph as a whole (paticularly, ifthere are visible layers below the group).  In fact, when we havenested pass-through groups, whether or not a layer is the lastnode depends on which group we're considering as the root (sincewe exclude the backdrop from the group's projection, resulting indifferent graphs for different groups).Instead of rolling our own graph traversal, just move the relevantlogic to GimpOperationLayerMode, and let GEGL do the work for us.At processing time, we can tell if we're the last node by checkingif we have any input.For this to work, GimpOperationLayerMode's process() function needsto have control over what's going on.  Replace the derived opclasses, which override process(), with a call to the layer mode'sfunction (as per gimp_layer_mode_get_function()) inGimpOperationLayerMode's process() function.  (Well, actually, thiscommit keeps the ops around, and just hacks around them ingimp_layer_mode_get_operation(), because laziness :P)Keep using the layer's is_last_node property to do the invalidation.	5
Avoid use of temporary files for accessing remote filesWhen using GIO/GVFS, remote files may have a local representationprovided by a FUSE mount. Try to detect this and access the filedirectly instead of using a temporary file. Fallback to the oldbehavior of using temporary files if GIO can't give us a local pathto the file.	2

app: check last GIMP release from gimp.org/gimp_versions.json.GIMP will now process the remote gimp_versions json file to look if oneis using the last version of GIMP. This initial code doesn't act up yeton this information. This will come in further commits.Here are the characteristics:- Since this requires internet access, a new checkbox is available in  the Preferences dialog, allowing to disable version checks. Note that  it is enabled by default as it is an important security feature, but  it has to be deactivatable.- The remote access is done as an async operation because we don't want  it to block the startup in any way (for whatever reason). Also it  doesn't output errors if it fails to not be a bother (you don't  technically need internet access for an image program).- We don't check at every startup. At each successful check, we save a  timestamp to prevent too frequent useless checks (I set it the timer  to a week or more for now).	1

plug-ins: let's special-case just a bit the HGT data.- Display title "Digital Elevation Model data" instead of just "Image".- Don't show the type combo anymore, since HGT is always 16-bit signed  integer in big endian.- Don't show the width and height either, but instead show a dropdown  list to choose between either SRTM-1 or SRTM-3 data. There seems to be  only these 2 types of data, and this will determine the width and  height. This choice (SRTM-1 vs 3) will mostly likely be better known  by people than knowing what image dimension they have to set,  especially since official links for such files seem to all include the  information.	5

build: do not build Windows dependencies with ccache.The build rules were highly inspired by other projects on GNOME'sGitlab. All of them used to build with ccache. It worked fine for themain build, but completely broke GObject Introspection build on bothbabl and GEGL. And the worse thing is that meson was absolutely notdisplaying the error, just saying it failed (even in verbose mode). Alot of time wasted trying to debug.Therefore let's get rid of ccache, but only for babl and GEGL. Keep itfor GIMP itself as it works fine there.Other minor changes:* Build from the build dir, rather than source. The other way around  works too, but I actually find commands simpler this way.* Adding artifacts.	1

It happened when setting a value whichcould not be properly displayed by current unit (typically smaller than1 in this unit, or with remainder).In such a case, we should not manually set private->shift beforegimp_int_combo_box_set_active(), or the callback was failing toreconfigure the GtkAdjustement, in particular min and max values.As a consequence, hitting a Preferences reset, with a GimpMemSizeEntryin Gigabytes, it got reset to Kilobytes with the max values capped at4096. So I realized a Reset ended me with a Tile cache size of 4096 KBin particular, which is of course ridiculously small and would be aproblem if one doesn't notice the issue immediately.	0

libgimpconfig: Prevent GIR conflicts in GimpConfigWriterGimpConfigWriter contains several constructors with the convention`gimp_config_writer_new_* ()`. This will lead to problems however withlanguages like Vala, where it cannot disambiguate the following:```// calls config_writer_new_string()Gimp.ConfigWriter w = new ConfigWriter.string("xxx");// calls config_writer_string()w.string("xxx")```Using `from_` in constructors is general practice in GObject-bsedlibraries because of this.This also fixes an error when trying to use vapigen on the GIMP .GIRfile.	2
app: pass the orig_tiles and their offset to GimpTransformTool::transform()instead of keeping them around as members. This is another artifactfrom ancient times. Also get rid of some more legacy junkcode. Disable more code in GimpTransformToolUndo but keep it aroundeven though it does nothing at the moment.	1

app: various brush hardness improvementsFix brush shrinking used to compensate for the blur: avoid over-shrinking the brush and changing its aspect ratio.Change the way hardness maps to blur radius: hardness == 0 maps tothe largest radius such that, when the kernel is applied to themiddle pixel of the brush, the kernel is completely within the brushbounds, taking brush shrinking into account, *assuming the brush isa circle*.Use the dimensions of the unrotated brush when calculating the blurradius, so that rotation doesn't affect the blur amount (the bluritself is not isotropic, though, and is applied after rotation, sowhile the blur amount remains uniform, its effect does depend on thebrush angle.)Get rid of the blur-radius upper limit -- it's fast enough to handlelarge radii now.	0

app: remove icon sizing preferences.With GTK+3, high or low density is taken care by the screen scalefactor. Having a separate preferences for this is redundant, and likelyeven wrong.It may be interesting though to have a new preference later, which wouldallow smaller scale icon sizing since some people like their iconslightly smaller or bigger, and also when you are using screens whosedensity is at a limit scale factor. Right now, this can be done throughthemes, but a GUI settings may be interesting. If I add such feature,let's just do it from scratch later.	1
app: apply common operation settings when reapplying a filterAdd a new gimp_drawable_apply_operation_with_config() function,which takes an operation node together with a config object, andapplies the operation using the config options, including both theoperation-specific options, and the common GimpOperationSettingsoptions.Use the function in gimp_gegl_procedure_execute(), so thatreapplying a filter takes the common operation settings usedoriginally into account.	1

app: add reset buttons to all brush settings sliders	1
libgimpwidgets, themes: more compact GimpSpinScale.There were some complaint about the height of these scale.The min-height was clearly too high. I also made the buttons a bit morecompact by removing a bit of padding.Finally I add a CSS name to the class, in order to avoid using theparent class name ("spinbutton"). This makes for clearer and morecustomizable themes (ability to style the GimpSpinScale without stylingGtkSpinButton too).	1

libgimpwidgets: fix percentage use in size-entry arithmetic when lower-bound != 0In GimpSizeEntry, the value corresponding to 0%, as pergimp_size_entry_set_size(), may be non-zero.  This works correctlywhen using the size entry in percentage mode, but not when usingprecentage as part of arithmetic.Fix this by adding an 'offset' parameter to eevl's unit-resolutioncallback, which can be specifies a constant value to add as partof unit conversion, after scaling the converted value by theconversion factor.  In GimpSizeEntry, use this parameter to offsetpercentages by their lower bound.	1

app: multi-layer aware layers-mask-add and layers-mask-add-button.These actions raise a GimpViewableDialog.

With several viewables,the preview won't show.This allows to add masks to all selected layers at once, with the samebasic options for all masks, as set in the dialog.	2

libgimp: API to create GimpParam from values.The `data` property of a GimpParam is a union. Unfortunately setting aunion is not supported by GObject Introspection yet. So I create someAPIs to create GimpParam-s from values. Note that this is temporary API(i.e. it may be removed before GIMP 3 release) since we likely won't usethis GimpParam type anymore with the new plug-in API. But for now, thisis necessary, at least for testing and porting Python plug-ins.Also for GimpParam to be actually introspectable, I had to make it aboxed type, but since no length information is available for variousvariants of the type (arrays, whose length information is a separateparameter), the copy and free functions are basically broken or leakingrespectively for all types requiring a length.Bottom line: this is ugly and we really need a new introspectableparameter type. But for now, it allows to start porting some of ourPython plug-ins.	1

Bug 684483 - Text tool: crash after double clicking textIt seems that when the undo action reverts a text -> mark-up change(or v.v.)  the notifications are inverted, first is emitted the newvalue notification and successively the property becoming NULL.

Bug 750594 - Colors in PSD files are far lighter on import and far darker on exportGIMP's PSD plugin was assuming that colors in PSD files are linearly interpolatedon both export and import. This commit fixes the issue by doing the following:- when importing, assume the colors are gamma interpolated in the entire image- when importing and exporting, treat the colors in each layer as gamma interpolated- when importing and exporting, treat indexed colors as actually indexed colors- when exporting, treat the interpolation in the channels and masks as linearly interpolated	2

Issue #3142 - Filters on-canvas preview doesn't work ...... immediately after an image precision changeWhen flushing a projection, make sure it has a buffer, instead ofbailing if it doesn't.  We rely on the image projection's "update"signal to update the display after certain operations that free thebuffer, which would previously fail to happen, and cause subsequentflushes to be ignored until the buffer is explicitly accessed.This fixes commit b07f8102738d8225c1e77e6b4f68ae12468d8a2b.	0

This commit causes any ongoingasync operations of the factories to be canceled on shutdown,rather than waiting for them to finish normally.	5
libgimpwidgets: add ratio expressions to eevlRatio expressions have the form 'x : y' (the ':' operator has thehighest precedence for a binary operator, and is left-associative).Given a reference value 'a', the expression evaluates to'a * (x / y)'.Ratio expressions can be controlled by the caller by:  - Enabling or disabling them:  They're meant to be used when the    eevl servers two paired entries, and can be disabled otherwise.  - Setting the reference value:  That's normally the value of the    "other" entry of the pair--the one not currently being    evaluated.  - Inverting the ratios:  Normally, one entry refers to the    antecedent term of the ratio, and the other entry refers to the    consequent term of the ratio.  When evaluating the latter one,    the ratio should be inverted.	1

pdb: fix previous commit to work with old and new meson (+ typo fix).The `env` option is new (from meson 0.57.0), yet we depend on meson0.50.0 and bumping the meson requirement is not a possibility (we havebad experience when we did this for babl).Instead, implement the new option usage and a workaround which wouldwork also with older meson.I could have implemented only the workaround, but it's also nice towrite down the better syntax so that when we actually bump mesonrequirement, getting rid of the workaround will just be a matter ofhitting delete and done. Though it also means we must keep both if/elseblocks in sync, so it has its drawbacks.See the discussion in !506.	4

app: exclude undo/redo actions from historyThe undo/redo actions' label changes based on context, and mayinterfere with the labels of more relevant, but less frequent,actions.For example, after applying filter Foo, the label of edit-undobecomes "Undo Foo", so searching for "Foo" results in bothedit-undo, and the action referring to the filter, with edit-undomost likely appearing at the top of the list due to its frequency.Excluding the undo/redo actions from the history is a simple, ifsuboptimal, way to fix this.	0

app, libgimp: get rid of all ID GTypes and ID param specsTurn all ID param specs into object param specs (e.g. GimpParamImageIDbecomes GimpParamImage) and convert between IDs and objects ingimpgpparams.c directly above the the wire protocol, so all of app/,libgimp/ and plug-ins/ can deal directly with objects down to thelowest level and not care about IDs.Use the actual object param specs for procedure arguments and returnvalues again instead of a plain g_param_spec_object() and bring backthe none_ok parameter.This implies changing the PDB type checking functions to work on pureintegers instead of IDs (one can't check whether object creation ispossible if performing that check requires the object to alreadyexist).For example gimp_foo_is_valid() becomes gimp_foo_id_is_valid() and isnot involved in automatic object creation magic at the protocollevel. Added wrappers which still say gimp_foo_is_valid() and take therespective objects.Adapted all code, and it all becomes nicer and less convoluted, eventhe generated PDB wrappers in app/ and libgimp/.	5

tools: update the build-only tool compute-svg-viewbox.It now uses rsvg_handle_get_geometry_for_layer() instead ofrsvg_handle_get_(position|dimensions)_sub() which have been deprecatedin favor of the new function which returns accurate (double) positioningand size.Back when I first made this build tool, librsvg had several blockingbugs to make icon extraction work properly. This seems to improvenicely.Nevertheless I still don't build this tool because after testing, morebugs remain and icon extraction is still not right. Just updating thecode to undeprecate it but leave the build commented out for now. ;-(See librsvg#134, librsvg#128 and librsvg#250 for bug reports followingthese issues.	0

libgimpbase, app: add abbreviations to gradient enumsThe value descriptions of GimpGradientColor,GimpGradientSegmentColor, and GimpGradientSegmentType enums appearin the on-canvas gradient editor UI, as combo-box items in the toolGUI overlay.  Since we want to keep the overlay as small aspossible, we previously used abbreviations for these descriptions(e.g., "FG (t)", instead of "Foreground (transparent)").Replace the abbreviated descriptions with unabbreviated ones, andmove the abbreviations to the "abbrev" parameter.  This way we getthe abbreviated version in the combo-box, and the full version inthe combo-box's menu.	1

Bug 795257 - Segmentation fault crash using the clone toolCommit f5cb1fed85341a9d0a46fb1391b19fa9ea3ccb42, which performedbrush outline generation in GimpPaintTool in synchrony with thepaint thread, wasn't enough, since GimpSourceTool could still callgimp_brush_tool_create_outline() directly during itsGimpDrawTool::draw() method, leading to the same race conditionwhen executed concurrently with the paint thread.Partially revert the above commit, so that outline generation ishandled as before, as far as GimpPaintTool is concenered.  Instead,add GimpPaintTool::{start,end,flush}_paint() virtual functions; thefirst two are called when starting/ending painting using the paintthread, while the third is called during the display-updatetimeout, while the main thread and the paint thread aresynchronized.  This allows subclasses to perform non-thread-safeactions while the threads are synchronized.Override these functions in GimpBrushTool, and cache the brushboundary in the flush() function.  Use the cached boundary ingimp_brush_tool_create_outline() while painting, to avoid the aboverace condition, both when this function is called throughGimpPaintTool, and through GimpSourceTool.	1

app: fix AppStream tag localization.As AppStream docs says, <description> "tag should be translatedby-paragraph" in upstream metadata, which is what we have always done(i.e. <_p> tags which becomes <p xml:lang="xy">).Unfortunately as_app_get_description() is optimized to work forCollection Metadata where the 'tag is translated "as a whole"' (againcf. specs) for faster parsing. So we were ending up with a text mixingthe original and all localized texts.I have opened a bug report to appstream-glib:https://github.com/hughsie/appstream-glib/issues/381While waiting for this to be fixed (i.e. when the function will handleboth cases accordingly to the metadata source), this code makes my ownlocale extraction (defaulting to original text which is assumed to bethe previous same level tag with no xml:lang if no tag with the exactlang attribute was found).	5

Bug 756678 - Layer opacities change upon saving and reopening an xcf fileAdd new XCF property FLOAT_OPACITY and always save both the old 8-bitand the new float opacity of layers and channels. Float opacity issaved after the 8-bit one so when loading, it overwrites the limited8-bit value with the proper precision. Do not increase the XCF versionnumber because old GIMP versions will simply skip the unknownFLOAT_OPACITY and keep using the 8-bit value.	1

file-jpeg: (save) Change the label for restart intervalThis was discussed in #gimp. The old label was "Frequency (rows)"which is misleading. This field is basically converted by libjpegto another value called a restart interval which is stored in aJPEG file. The restart interval specifies after how many MCUsthe restart (syncronization) marker appears in the bitstream.It is not easy to explain to a layperson what an MCU is.The value in the dialog specifies after how many *MCU rows* therestart marker appears. This is a libjpeg thing, and libjpegconverts it to the restart interval.I have merely renamed the text label of the field and PDBdescription as the current text implies pixel rows which is notthe case.A better alternative is to use the restart interval (in MCUs,not MCU rows) as saved in the file itself, which more peoplethan users of libjpeg would understand. But even that settingis not something that can easily be explained to a layperson.	1

app: change text tool font size default.With bigger and denser default images, the older 18px font default isvery small (~ 4pt font at 300PPI).I decided to settle for a 15pt font, i.e. 62 px at 300 PPI, which seemslike quite an acceptable relative size for our FullHD defaults.It is bigger than a default font size for âsayâ a text processor, butGIMP is not really designed to process large walls of small text anyway.Rather shorter texts at bigger sizes (i.e. designs, etc.). So this seemslike quite an ok default.Note that as any defaults, this only goes as far and won't be what mostpeople need most of the time anyway. But at least we should get rid ofthis ridiculous 18px default.	1
build: enable WebKit dependency and get a full-feature Flatpak build!The build has been fixed by a patch from Upstream:https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=156510Note that WebKit takes hours to build, so if you just want to testFlatpak, you may prefer disable this module again.We now have a full-feature Flatpak build, except for libgudev, whichmeans that special input devices probably won't work in the GIMPFlatpak. It is to be noted that Flatpak developers told me thatlibudev won't work inside the sandbox anyway. A portal will haveto be implemented.

app: add GimpTransformGridTool; derive most transform tools from itWhile most of our transform tools use an interactive transformgrid, and have similar behavior, the flip tool is an odd one out.The new "auto straighten" function of the measure tool introducesanother tool that performs transformations, while not behaving likethe rest of the transform tools.Factor out the parts of GimpTransformTool that handle userinteraction into GimpTransformGridTool (with correspondingGimpTransformGridOptions, and GimpTransformGridToolUndo), and onlyleave the basic transform functionality and options inGimpTransformTool (and GimpTransformOptions).Derive all the transform tools (and transform-tool base classes)that previously derived from GimpTransformTool, fromGimpTransformGridTool.  The one exception is GimpFlipTool, whichstill derives from GimpTransformTool directly.  The next commitwill derive GimpMeasureTool from GimpTransformTool as well.	1

Bug 565459 - newly opened images are put into the backgroundWhen we are going to open new image windows, unset the transientwindow.

app: add gimp_item_{start,end}_move()Add gimp_item_{start,end}_move(), and correspondingGimpItem::{start,end}_move() virtual functions, which should becalled before/after "moving" the item (i.e., translating, scaling,resizing, flipping, rotating, or transforming the item).  Movesperformed between the outermost pair of start/end calls are treatedatomically.What exactly does "treated atomically" entail depends on thesubclasses -- GimpItem doesn't provide a default implementation forthese functions, so the current commit doesn't change any behavior.The next commit, which adds layer-mask support for group layers,uses the functions to avoid cropping the mask too early while achild is moving.GimpItem calls {start,end}_move() in the various "move" functions(gimp_item_{translate,scale,...}(), before performing the actualoperation.  Additionally we call the functions in thegimp_image_item_list_foo() functions, for each participating item,so that the items are moved as a unit.  We call the functions inthe various gimp_image_remove_foo() functions, since removing anitem may affect the size of its ancestors, and is therefore akin tomoving.  We also call the functions in GimpEditSelectionTool, sothat the move tool moves items atomically while dragging.	4

A spacing of 200.0 means onlyalternate spaces are filled with the brush paint. A setting of 50.0means the brush paints positions overlap by 50% of the brush width.So 100.0 corresponds to exactly the brush width! It took meages to figure this simple thing out!)	1

build: remove calls to ccache in native Windows build.Anyway we disabled use of ccache in an earlier commit 2da70b3fb7 becauseof a bug in MSYS2's CPython. So there is no need to call these commandseither. Also it seems to be breaking the 32-bit native Windows build(from CI log, I am unsure this is because of ccache, but the breakhappens just after running `ccache --zero-stats`).	1

Issue #3493: GIMP changes R-channel, when it should not.Instead of treating any unspecified TIFF channel as non-premultipliedalpha, let's now ask the user (in non-interactive case, we continuedefaulting to non-premultiplied channel and outputing a message). The 3choices are: premultiplied, non-premultiplied (which is the default soyou can just hit Enter and get same result as previously) and channel.It's still not perfect as it still assumes that an alpha channel willnecessarily be the first extra channel (though the spec does not mandatesuch assumption). Let's say for now that it is enough. Using extrachannels for the alpha channel only is most likely the most common usage(actually the spec only has specific types for such usage).	1

app: remove "Edit -> Fade..."This commit completely removes the "Edit -> Fade..." feature,because...- The main reason is that "fade" requires us to keep two buffers,  instead of one, for each fadeable undo step, doubling (or worse,  since the extra buffer might have higher precision than the  drawable) the space consumed by these steps.  This has notable  impact when editing large images.  This overhead is incurred even  when not actually using "fade", and since it seems to be very  rarely used, this is too wasteful.- "Fade" is broken in 2.10: when comitting a filter, we copy the  cached parts of the result into the apply buffer.  However, the  result cache sits after the mode node, while the apply buffer  should contain the result of the filter *before* the mode node,  which can lead to wrong results in the general case.- The same behavior can be trivially achieved "manually", by  duplicating the layer, editing the duplicate, and changing its  opacity/mode.- If we really want this feature, now that most filters are GEGL  ops, it makes more sense to just add opacity/mode options to the  filter tool, instead of having this be a separate step.	1

So I believe/hope that I didn't mess up somewhere,but it looks as the cleaning went all fine.	4

plug-ins: port help-browser to WebKitGTK+ 2This is the minimum set of changes needed to update help-browser to theWebKitGTK+ 2 API. Fortunately, the plug-in did not use parts of the oldAPI which would have been difficult to port (DOM bindings, for example),and therefore the code translates quite well to the new API. The maindifferences are:- WebKitWebFrame is gone, most of its methods are now in WebKitWebView.- Searching for text inside Web pages has to be done now through the  WebKitFindController object.- Checking whether there is selected text that can be copied now goes  through WebKitEditorState.- The WebKitWebView::title-changed signal is no more, the callback is  connected to notify::title instead.- The load-started and load-finished pair of signals are now merged  into WebKitWebView::load-changed.- There are no methods to zoom a WebKitWebView in and out, instead  the zoom-level property is set. The updated code ensures that the  zoom lovel stays inside the [0.1, 10.0] range.- Page visit history now goes through WebKitBackForwardList.The updated plug-in was successfully built in tested with WebKitGTK+version 2.20.3.	3

Bug 796014 - Cannot open some older .xcf files made with 2.8.22 in 2.10.To avoid an infinite loop, gimp_item_linked_is_locked() was temporarilyunlinking items before calling gimp_item_is_position_locked(). Thisworked only based on gimp_item_real_is_position_locked() code whichcalled gimp_item_linked_is_locked() only when it was linked. It did nottake into account the fact that it was an abstract method which couldhave other implementations. In particular the group layer implementationwould call in turn gimp_item_is_position_locked() on each child layer.Basically temporarily unsetting the link was anyway a very ugly hack.The point is simply that we are only interested by the value of the`lock_position` flag for this item, without further "intelligence". Forthis, use gimp_item_get_lock_position() instead.	1

Fix #4560 - file-xpm saving unused transparencyThe XPM export plugin was saving the color `None` (transparency) to theexported image palette for all images with an alpha channel, even if thecolor was not used on any pixel.Since it's nice to have `None` as the first color on the palette, mappedto character ' ', and it could be too wasteful to scan all pixels twice,the approach taken was to just undo it's premature insertion.(cherry picked from commit 0a9bb2839eddfc272d78ce63626665f2810b80f4)	1

app: add GimpToolGyroscopeGimpToolGyroscope is a tool widget providing canvas interaction for3D rotation.  The widget doesn't preset a UI, but ratherfacilitates panning, rotation, and zoom, by dragging the canvas, orusing the keyboard.Rotation is expressed using yaw/pitch/roll angles (performed inthis order).  A zoom factor can be specified, which affects themagnitude of the rotation per distance traveled.  The widget canoperate in inverse mode, performing an inverse transformation.	1

icons: install switch-(on|off)-symbolic icons in GIMP's hicolor theme.These icons are not available in any of our themes (Symbolic or Color).Also they don't seem to be available in many icon themes either actuallyand I'm not sure GIMP properly fallbacks to system icon theme when anicon is missing in the selected theme anyway (I think to remember thisused to work, but it doesn't look like it works anymore).Anyway I just copied the 2 symbolic switch on|off icons available in theGTK+ repository at gtk/icons/scalable/status/. These are supposed to beused by GtkSwitch but somehow they aren't. So for the time being, let'sbundle them directly with GIMP (until we figure something better out).I put them in hicolor because this is the generic/default theme which isalways used as last resort and is common to any theme. It means anyspecific theme will be able to override these icons, but if missing,hicolor will be able to provide a fallback.	1

build: Prefer to find libwmf using pkg-configTraditional -config scripts are awkward for cross-compilation, multilibsystems (lib/lib64), and multiarch systems like Debian; only one copyof the -config script can be in the PATH. As a result, some OSdistributions are starting to deprecate or even remove them.pkg-config is designed to be a replacement for traditional -configscripts, and is cross-compilation-friendly: the PKG_CHECK_MODULES macrolooks for an architecture-specific executable likex86_64-linux-gnu-pkg-config, which can look in an architecture-specificsearch path for library metadata, before falling back to a genericpkg-config executable.As a bonus, pkg-config also compares version numbers correctly(see #2454).libwmf having pkg-config metadata seems to be a relatively new thing,so I've kept the -config script code path too, using it if pkg-configdoes not find libwmf.Bug-Debian: https://bugs.debian.org/956183Signed-off-by: Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>	0

file-jpeg: Add support for arithmetic codingArithmetic coding is a feature of the JPEG standard. Although libjpeghad always implemented arithmetic coding, it was compiled out by defaultdue to patents.Those patents have now expired.libjpeg 8 now enables arithmetic coding by default. Distributions whichuse libjpeg < 8 can also support arithmetic coding by using theappropriate CFLAGS to enable it. libjpeg-turbo 1.3.1 also has supportfor arithmetic coding and is in popular shipping distributions.Software such as jpegtran can losslessly convert Huffman compressedimages to arithmetic coding and vice versa. The lossy behavior of JPEGdoes not happen at this (bit coding) layer of the format.This initial patch provides a checkbox (disabled by default) to createfiles which use arithmetic coding. It also has a tooltip warning thatsuch files may not be compatible with older decoders.	2

NEWS: keep up-to-date.	5
app: improve sample text logics for CJK fonts.First of all, "CJK Unified Ideographs" block should not be the highestpriority to determine showing an ideograph. Indeed most fonts for aKorean and Japanese audience would also contain at least the mainideographs. So instead, look first for Korean alphabet (Hangul) andJapanese syllabaries to determine if it's a Korean or Japanese-targettedfont. Only then Chinese.Also check Korean before Japanese because most of the Korean fonts I sawactually also include Japanese syllabaries (but not the other wayaround).This way, it will be much easier for CJK graphists to skim through thefont list and detect fonts made for the needed language in a glance.Also modifying the Korean display text. KIYEOK and SSANGKIYEOK wereobviously chosen because they were the first in the block. But they arevery bad choice. We hesitated with ê° at first, as it is considered thefirst in the syllabary form (ê°ëë¤ë¼ is kind of similar to our ABCD).But it wouldn't show a form with a second consonant (below) which is agood stylistic indication. So we hesitated between í (han) and ê¸(geul, which also means text so it's a nice sample), and finally wentwith í because of the circle shape in ã (hieut) but also its small"hat" which has many stylistic variants. So it's quite a good hint ofstylistic choices made by a font designer from just the sample box.Moreover I switched the block check from "Hangul Jamo" to "HangulSyllables" block. "Hangul Jamo" are positional forms of the letters todynamically compose syllables (in particular legacy syllables not in useanymore). Though a feature-full Korean font set would design these, itis less important than "Hangul Syllables" (pre-composed syllablesdesign) or "Hangul Compatibility Jamo" (basically the same letters as"Hangul Jamo" but for standalone usage). Also I actually saw some fontsmade for Korean without "Hangul Syllables" support.Finally I also added a test for Japanese. I check the Hiragana blockwhich is most likely the most basic which has to be in anyJapanese-targetted font and use 'ã' (a) as sample text, which is thefirst Hiragana syllable and here definitely a good sample text in myopinion.I believe that this can still be improved though. Checking only a singleblock to determine the probable target language is not necessarilyenough. For instance very complete fonts for Chinese may also designKorean and Japanese characters, but will also have most CJK blocks andmore ideographs (whereas Japanese/Korean will likely have less). Yetlet's say this is good for now, at least better than before!	1

Cleanup the Gitlab runner manually.Ok so this is horrible, but this is the only way I found to get pastsome errors.

This is completely horrible (and I sure hope it won't come upagain with different files each time) but really the only workaround Ifound so far (I think a real solution will have to come from Gitlab codeor from the GNOME admins, not sure what is the exact source of theproblem).	0

app: reduce redraws on statusbarThis change reduces redraws due to spurious status updates.Before this change, the status would be unset, then set again to thesame value it was previously. Each turn around setting and unsettingcauses a redraw.On macOS this redraw causes a full screen redraw. With thisoptimization, when the status message is unchanged, no redraw occurs.This is because `gimp_tool_push_status` checks to see if the messagehas changed.	4

libgimpconfig: this is the appropriate fix for the previous assert.Since the parsing failure I was experiencing was normal (not a bug), andsince I was not seeing error being passed down to deserialize(), Iassume this assert was always wrong. I hadn't realize that the GErrorobject was in fact populated by deserialized through g_scanner_error()calls which were setting the GError passed at creation of the scannerthrough a handler.So there was indeed a bug in one of the functions called by ourdeserialize() implementation. There was one failure case where the errorwas just reported with g_warning() instead of g_scanner_error().Now that it's fixed, I brought back the asserts (previous commits)because the error object is actually always well populated.	0

Bug 789173 - Make canvas rotation information visible on the main windowNow add also flip information in the status bar so that one knows thatthe canvas is flipped horizontally and/or vertically.

Nowit will be possible to check in a single glimpse at the status bar.Similarly to what I previously did for the rotation information, hittingthe flip icons in status will allow to unflip easily without having togo in menus or remember all shortcuts.These information will be visible only when the canvas is flipped orrotated.	5

libgimp: progress: partially fix native window idUpdate `gimp_window_get_native_id()` a little to be more correct(although it still won't work on Wayland).Most important of all, we shouldn't assume that if a given GDK backendis enabled at compile time, that this is also the one that is beingused. For example, on Linux, both `GDK_WINDOWING_X11` and`GDK_WINDOWING_WAYLAND` can be set, but you still need to do a runtimecheck if you're running under one WM or the the other.A small cleanup is that we immediately check if a widget is realized bychecking if it's `GdkWindow` is NULL or not and return immediately(since we need to check its type later on anyway).Finally, we can remove `GDK_NATIVE_WINDOW_POINTER` as that is a GTK+ 2.0construct, so it's dead code anyway.	4

app, icons, menus: add performance-log recording to the dashboardAdd an option to record a performance log through the dashboard.The log contains a series of samples of the dashboard variables, aswell as the full program backtrace, when available.  As such, itessentially acts as a built-in profiler, which allows us tocorrelate program execution with the information available throughthe dashboard.  It is meant to be used for creating logs toaccompany perofrmance-related bug reports, as well as for profilingGIMP during development.The sample frequency defaults to 10 samples per second, but can beoverridden using the GIMP_PERFORMANCE_LOG_SAMPLE_FREQUENCYenvironment variable.  Backtraces are included by default whenavailable, but can be suppressed using theGIMP_PERFORMANCE_LOG_NO_BACKTRACE environment variable.Logs are created through the new "record" button at the bottom ofthe dashboard dialog.  When pressed, a file dialog is opened toselect the log file, and, once confirmed, data is being recorded tothe selected file.  Recording is stopped by pressing the "record"button again (we use a highlight to indicate that recording isactive.)While recording, the "reset" button is replaced with an "add marker"button, which can be used to add event markers to the log.  Thesecan be used to mark events of interest, such as "started painting"and "stopped painting", which then appear in the log as part of thesample stream.  Markers are numbered sequentually, and the numberof the next (to-be-added) marker appears on the button.  Shift-clicking the button adds an empty (description-less) marker, whichis only identified by its number; this can be used when markersneed to be added quickly.The log is an XML file, containing some extra information (such asthe output of "$ gimp -v", and symbol information) in addition tothe samples.  The data in the file is delta-encoded to reduce thefile size, meaning that samples (as well as some other elements)only specify the changes since the previous sample.  This adds anecessary decoding step before data can be processed; the nextcommit adds a tool that does that.There are currently no tools to actually analyze the data -- that'sstill TBD -- but at least we can start gathering it.	5

app: fix leak of a GdkPoint and improve stable zoom centering logics.This started as yet another report of leak by Massimo. But really theleak of the GdkPoint created by the functiongimp_display_shell_push_zoom_focus_pointer_pos() is not only whendelta_y is 0. There are a few code paths in gimp_display_shell_scale()when we would not pop this point. One of them is for instance whenwindow resizing in multi-window mode is allowed. There might be more(but the code is convoluted enough not to be 100% sure if these arepossible with our specific case).This specific function was initially created only to be used for unittesting code (commit 7e3898da093), but it ended up being also usedinternally (commit 792cd581a21). Since I see that the test for whichthis code was initially created even seem broken right now (the assertpart for position check is commented out!), I even wonder if we shouldkeep it. We could indeed instead just add optional start_x|y argumentsto gimp_display_shell_scale(), which would be much cleaner. But I leaveit for now.Instead I just make sure we clean the created GdkPoint after callinggimp_display_shell_scale(). Also I get rid of the GQueue. It is clear inthe code that we are not expecting queuing interaction of severalpositions. Worse right now, we could end up in weird cases where thepushed points are not used when they should, then could end up beingused later in totally unrelated interactions (this would make the shellposition jump here and there). So let's just make it a single point.Finally adding some appropriate comments in parts which are still a bitwrong.	0

app: rename and merge the spline and segment length properties...... in GimpBucketFillOptions for the line art algorithm.Inside GimpLineArt, there are still 2 properties, but we don't show themanymore in the Bucket Fill tool options. One of the main reason isprobably that it's hard to differentiate their usage. One is to closewith curved lines, the other with straight segments. Yet we don'tactually have any control on one or the other. All one knows is that youcan have "holes" in your drawing of a given size and you want themclose-like for filling. Only reason I can see to have 2 types of closureis whether you'd want to totally disable one type of closure (then youset it to 0). But this is a very limited reason for making the optionsless understandable overall, IMO.So for the time being, let's show up only a single option which setsboth properties in GimpLineArt. As patdavid says "it makes sense as afirst pass".Also rename the option to shorter/simpler "Maximum gap length". Thanksto patdavid and pippin for helping on figuring out this better label!Finally I am bumping the default for the gaps to 100px. The originalvalues were ok for the basic small images used in demos, but not forreal life image where it was always too short (even 100px may still betoo short actually, but much better than the 20 and 60px from before!).	1

Issue #1850 - Undoing the "straighten" operation in the Measure tool ...... does not restore the measure pointsHalt the measure tool after straightening, thus removing theexpectation that undoing the operation should restore the originalpoints.Halting the tool, rather than making undo work "as expected",sidesteps several issues:  - Implementing undo correctly is tricky, since image-undo and    tool-undo are handled separately.  - In fact, the measure tool doesn't provide tool-undo, so that    image edits can be undone while the tool is active without    affecting the tool, and it's not clear that we want to change    this behavior.  However, this makes undoing a straighten    operation a special case, and it's not entirely clear what the    behavior should be when undoing other kinds of transformations,    or when the measure points had changed since the straighten    operation.  - Perhaps most importantly, measure tool points are restricted to    the pixel grid, which means that when measuring an angle    against an orientation that's not fully horizontal or vertical    in image space (either using a 3-point angle, or when the    canvas is rotated), the resulting transformed point after    straightening doesn't generally land on the pixel grid, causing    it to be rounded, which can result in a non-zero angle after    the rotation.  This is especially ugly, since clicking    "straighten" again at this point would cause another non-    trivial rotation.	1

app: when called with --quit, GIMP exit code will report batch failure.If you call GIMP with batch commands and ask it to quit immediately, youare likely interested by failure information. For this reason, let's nowreport exit code other than success, but only in such case. Inparticular, even if the batch commands fail, but GIMP is not set to exitimmediately, we continue reporting SUCCESS run at the very end (whenexiting interactively).Note that I hardcode a few exit values, as standardly found on Linux(but not using headers which may not be found on all platforms; inparticular, Windows apparently doesn't use any standard code other than0 for success, from what my searches return).Additionally, when several commands are requested, GIMP will now stop atthe first failing and will return its error code, and print a message onstderr to easily report the failed command for easier debugging.	0

First I addour own exception handler using Win32 API SetUnhandledExceptionFilter().Second, I reorder things so that ExcHndlInit() is run after this setter,since they will be executed as a FILO and we need backtraces to begenerated before our separate GUI runs. Last I run the backtrace GUI asasync. No need to keep the main GIMP waiting since the traces havealready been generated into a separate file.Also replace gtk_show_uri() by the implementation taken straight fromour web-browser plug-in, since apparently gtk_show_uri() doesn't work inWindows (and probably not macOS either since I see we have a separateimplementation for this platform as well). I would like to be able touse the PDB but can't because this code needs to be usable both withinthe main process and into a separate tool process. Ideally, this shouldjust be a utils function which could be included without a problem.	0

app: new error dialog to backtrace and encourage people to report bugs.GIMP will now try to get a backtrace (on Unix machines only for now,using g_on_error_stack_trace(); for Windows, we will likely have to lookinto DrMinGW).This is now applied to CRITICAL errors only, which usually means majorbugs but are currently mostly hidden unless you run GIMP in terminal.

Bug 780015 - Filter settings are not properly restored after Gimp restartFilters settings used to be serialized and deserialized onlywhen a filter tool's GUI was shown, too late for the code thatre-runs/re-shows filters with previous values.Move the entire loading/saving code to gimp-operation-config.c, evenadding/removing the dummy separator item between timestamped automatichistory and manually saved settings. Load the settings automaticallywhen a settings container is requested, but still trigger saving fromthe few places the container is changed in the GUI; could alsoautomate that later.This commit also moves all settings of filters that have their owntools from gimpdir/tool-options/ to gimpdir/filters/. Add compat codeto try the old filename if the new doesn't exist, so files aremigrated automatically.WIP, but this step already fixes the bug.	0

Issue #2495: different code for Windows and Linux on duplicate devices.After discussing with Mitch, it turn out commit 717c183a3e was fixing(or rather working around) actual issues of broken device/usb stackissues on Linux, as expected.Nevertheless on Windows, this broke in turn many tablets (see commitce24e16083). Therefore we do a very ugly #ifdef to bail from duplicatedevices on Windows whereas we continue on Linux. This fix and differenceof behavior is completely empirical, rather than based on actual goodlogics, so that's quite annoying, but wellâ¦ not much choice here.Also note that since we had no report of breakage on other OSes (such asmacOS/BSD), at least that I know of, I let them with the Linux codepath.	4

app: revert to "gimp-paintbrush-tool" as default tool.A UI unit test (paintbrush_is_standard_tool()) was expecting thepaintbrush tool to be the default tool. This actually does not fit withmy tests as the crop tool was always the default tool if I were todelete my config folder and start anew. Yet it was working for the unittesting at the very least since `make check` used to work until now, andwas broken by my change.Anyway with my new code (commit 31e38fe869) and this additional one, nowit should work both for unit tests and real usage.

app: get rid of server grabs for almost all canvas interactionBecause it's generally the right thing to do, and server grabs brokebadly with input devices / client side windows.gimpdisplayshell-grab.c: change logic to only server-grab if an eventis passed to the pointer grab/ungrab functions, but always usegtk_grab_add/remove() which is sufficient in most cases.gimpdisplayshell-tool-events.c: have the grab functions grab theserver only for space-bar scrolling and do all tool interaction,including ruler clicks, with gtk_grab_add/remove(). Refactor thingsa bit to also use the grab API for button-2 scrolling.gimpdeviceinfo-coords.c: transform the event's coords to the canvas'coordinate system, they might come from a ruler now.This fixes the following bugs:Bug 645315 - gimp_display_shell_pointer_grab: gdk_pointer_grab failed...Bug 644351 - Gimp misses some strokes especially when drawing fastBug 645747 - Gimp is now unusable on xfce4	0
libgimpwidgets, app, plug-ins: fix last GIR warnings.gimp_int_radio_group_new() was still complaining about the scope ofradio_button_callback().

app: make demo scripting even simpler/cleaner.First I strip now every pieces of text. What it allows it to span thescript elements for instance on several lines, indent them and all that.The second thing is that since all the dockable start with "gimp-", wemay as well allow use shorter names (both are allowed). Same for tool(which we special-case), all the tool buttons ID start with "tools-"since we reused the action names. So let's just allow the shorterversions.Finally I create a new gimp_blink_toolbox() which is a specializedgimp_blink_dockable() for the toolbox in particular. I also move therethe whole code about selecting the right tool.	4
app: replace GimpDraable's type by a Babl formatand change gimp_drawable_new() and all gimp_layer_new() variants totake formats instead of types.	1

tools: do not segfault gimptool with source without extension.Since commit 58fa382001, gimptool would accept source files withnon-standard extensions when using known C or C++ compilers.

Merged the Polygon Select Tool capabilities with the Free Select Tool.2008-05-18  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>Merged the Polygon Select Tool capabilities with the Free SelectTool. Among the things still to do is improved help texts, moresuitable graphics, and cursor mangement, but the corefunctionality is in place. Thanks to Alexia Death for initialtesting. It will also be neccesary to do some work to adapt theForeground Select Tool to the new Free Select Tool implementation.Quick instructions on how the tool works: o A click adds a polygonal segment, a drag adds a free-hand   segment o Return-key commits, Escape-key cancels, Backspace-key removes   last segment o You can grab and move segment vertices o You can cancel both a move, and the creation of a segment* app/tools/gimpfreeselecttool.[ch]: More or lessreimplemented. We keep a sequential array of all the points in thepolygon (including the free segments), and we have another arraywith point indices that we use to represent the segments. On topof this we have a few helper functions that tries to abstract awaythe pretty raw nature of the implementation.* app/tools/gimpforegroundselecttool.[ch]: Keep track on its ownlast_coord, and adjust to the new implementation of the FreeSelect Tool. Still needs some work, for example handling that theFree Select Tool now resets GimpTool::display.(gimp_foreground_select_tool_key_press): Pass on key event toparent class when appropriate.

icons, tools: start grouping icons by their usage.There are some clear and obvious groups in the icons. For instance, thePreferences icons are one of them. Looking up the code, we only use themin 16px (in Preferences side menu) and 48px (in Preferences pageheaders). Until now, we were storing in other unrelated size (22px) andalso the lists per-sizes were not consistent. Some icons were missinghere, other there.With this new organization, the Preferences icons are listed in a singlefile, ensuring usage and contents consistency. Also it allows to installthem only for the needed sizes (note that it is possible that they mightbe needed in different size, for instance with custom themes; but wecan't just randomly distribute icons in all sizes; or to be moreaccurate, this is exactly why we encourage rather the SVG/scalableicons, so if some people explicitly go for raster icons, they also getthe drawbacks which come with).Last note: it may be possible that some icons end up in different"semantic" icon group. This is not a problem with this new organizationas my scripts handle duplicates gracefully.	0
