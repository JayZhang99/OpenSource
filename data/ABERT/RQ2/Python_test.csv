"Add different modes to sort dag files for parsing (#15046)This commit adds the feature to allow users to set one of the following modes, the scheduler will list and sort the dag files to decide the parsing order.:- `modified_time`: Sort by modified time of the files. This is useful on large scale to parse the recently modified DAGs first.- `random_seeded_by_host`: Sort randomly across multiple Schedulers but with same order on the same host. This is useful when running with Scheduler in HA mode where each scheduler can parse different DAG files.- `alphabetical`: Sort by filename",2

"Added k9s as integrated tool to help with kubernetes testing (#12163)The K9s is fantastic tool that helps to debug a running k8sinstance. It is terminal-based windowed CLI that makes youseveral times more productive comparing to using kubectlcommands. We've integrated k9s (it is run as a docker containerand downloaded on demand). We've also separated out KUBECONFIGof the integrated kind cluster so that it does not mess withkubernetes configuration you might already have.Also - together with that the ""surrounding"" of the kubernetestests were simplified and improved so that the k9s integrationcan be utilized well. Instead of kubectl port forwarding (whichcaused multitude of problems) we are now utilizing kind'sportMapping feature + custom NodePort resource that mapsport 8080 to 30007 NodePort which in turn maps it to 8080port of the Webserver. This way we do not have to establishan external kubectl port forward which is prone to error andmanagement - everything is brought up when Airflow getsdeployed to the Kind Cluster and shuts down when the Kindcluster is stopped.Yet another problem fixed was killing of postgres by one of thekubernetes tests ('test_integration_run_dag_with_scheduler_failure').Instead of just killing the scheduler it killed all pods - includingthe Postgres one (it was named 'airflow-postgres.*'). That causedvarious problems, as the database could be left in a strange state.I changed the tests to do what it claimed was doing - so killing only thescheduler during the test. This seemed to improve the stabilityof tests immensely in my local setup.",1

Thiscommit only enables the support for running mps3_an547 on QEMU, sincecurrently there isn't a FVP transporter on microTVM. The main differencebetween these two emulators is that FVP is provided by Arm as a closedsource emulator and it supports the Ethos-U55 accelerator.The mps3_an547 is an Arm reference board. For more details, please see:https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/development-boards/fpga-prototyping-boards/mps3Since there are already specific tests enabled on the CI to testEthos using the AOT executor, for instance, this commit will only addsupport for mps3_an547 using QEMU for now, also enabling the board to betested on the CI.The FPU is disabled on this commit (""fpu"": false, in boards.json). Thisis due to commit d4cc1c2196 (""target/arm: Enable MVE in Cortex-M55"")being absent in QEMU v6.1.1, so it's not available in any zephyr-sdkrelease yet. That commit enables MVE (M-Profile Vector Extension) and sofully enables the instructions to run the code generated when FPU isenabled on Zephyr. It's available from QEMU v6.2.0.This commit also adds support for the QEMU_BIN_PATH env variable so itturns easy setting an alternative QEMU version other than the one thatis available via PATH, when running / testing any virtualized board,either by the CI in the future or locally by the users/devs.Finally this commit fixes two typos in comments.Signed-off-by: Gustavo Romero <gustavo.romero@linaro.org>* mehrdadh review: Add comment on why FPU is disabled if mps3_an547 supports it",1

"Backport fix to allow pickling of Loggers to Python 3.6 (#18798)When sending objects around via multiprocessing (on Python 3.6 or lower)it would fail if that object contained a Logger object.To fix that we have ""backported"" the change in Python 3.7 to make Loggerobjects be pickled ""by name"". (In Python 3.7 the change adds`__reduce__` methods on to the Logger and RootLogger objects, but herewe achieve it `copyreg` stdlib module so we don't monkeypatchanything.)This mainly applies to using Kubernetes client >12 (which is notcurrently possible as we restrict that version) but this adds supportfor it anywhere it might happen inside Python 3.6.",1

"[RPC] Prefer IPv4 between IPv4 and IPv6 (#7013)This change fix problem with version of IP protocol on MacOS.  Previousthe `rpc_tracker` and `query_rpc_tracker` were not able connect to eachother with default hostnames.The root cause was in method `socket.getaddrinfo`. In `rpc_tracker` thedefault hostname is ""0.0.0.0"" and `getaddrinfo` returns IPv4 type. In`query_rpc_tracker` the default hastname is ""localhost"" and`getaddrinfo` on MacOS returns IPv6 type. Note: on Linux both have IPv4type.These tools worked by different protocols and this is why`query_rpc_tracker` wasn't able connect to `rpc_tracker`.Now we will prefer IPv4 type. And both `rpc_tracker` and`query_rpc_tracker` will use the same version of protocol.",1

"GitHub Action lint Python code for syntax errors (#4688)* GitHub Action lint Python code for syntax errorshttps://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/error-codes.htmlOn the flake8 test selection, this PR does _not_ focus on ""_style violations_"" (the majority of flake8 error codes that [__psf/black__](https://github.com/psf/black) can autocorrect).  Instead these tests are focus on runtime safety and correctness:* E9 tests are about Python syntax errors usually raised because flake8 can not build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).  Often these issues are a sign of unused code or code that has not been ported to Python 3.  These would be compile-time errors in a compiled language but in a dynamic language like Python they result in the script halting/crashing on the user.* F63 tests are usually about the confusion between identity and equality in Python.  Use ==/!= to compare str, bytes, and int literals is the classic case.  These are areas where __a == b__ is True but __a is b__ is False (or vice versa).  Python >= 3.8 will raise SyntaxWarnings on these instances.* F7 tests logic errors and syntax errors in type hints* F82 tests are almost always _undefined names_ which are usually a sign of a typo, missing imports, or code that has not been ported to Python 3.  These also would be compile-time errors in a compiled language but in Python a __NameError__ is raised which will halt/crash the script on the user.* Force a retest* Rename start_rpc_server_to_tracker.py to start_rpc_server_to_tracker.shThis is a bash file, not a Python file.",2

This means all BYOC configurations options needed by Collage can  be captured uniformly by a list-of-Targets. It also means RPC boundaries (as used  internally at OctoML) only need to worry about maintaining the fidelity of the  Target instance(s) rather than reaching into the PassContext.- Compilation is switched from function-at-a-time (relying on the TECompiler) to  IRModule-at-a-time (using the RelayToTIR target-specific hook mechanism). Though  not strictly necessary for Collage I want to check the path is now clear to  deprecate the support for BYOC in TEComplier.- Get all the TensorRT tests going again, except for a few I've disabled with  x-link to a new issue #11765. CAUTION: The TensorRT runtime is not supported in  CI so many of these tests are cosmetic.- While trying to track down a 'free(): invalid pointer' error in test_tensorrt_int8_exp.py  made the TensorRT allocs/frees more robust, but turns out its also broken in main.

"[microTVM][RVM] Always destroy the VM if all tests pass (#8739)Currently base-box-tool 'test' command will skip destroying the test VMif a single provider is specified (i.e. --provider virtualbox) even ifall tests pass. This is confusing (no warning is displayed to the user)and that will leave host resources (like USB devices necessary to runthe test) locked by the VM. So if the user tries to run a program thatuses the locked resource (e.g. openocd) cryptic failures might happen.Moreoever, even if all tests pass and more than one provider isspecified but the option '--skip-build' is set a VM will be left runningwithout notice.This commit changes that behavior by:1. Always destroying the VM if the release test pass2. Always keeping the VM up and running if a test fails1. guarantees no resource remains locked by the VM without necessity. Anew flag '--skip-destroy' is introduced in case the user still wants tokeep a VM up and running if the release tests pass. 2. guarantees the VMwhere the test failed is left running for further inspection of the testthat failed.Finally, for both 1. and 2. cases a proper message is displayed to theuser to inform if a VM was left running or not and about what actionsthe user can take next accordingly to the test result in the VM.Signed-off-by: Gustavo Romero <gustavo.romero@linaro.org>",3

"Stronger language about Docker Compose customizability (#22304)* Stronger language about Docker Compose customizabilityDespite our warnings, our users continue treating the DockerCompose that we exposed as something that should be easy toextend and customize for their own needs, yet they continueto struggle with some basic behaviour of containers, Docker Composeand how they interact. This results in vast space of potentialproblems as Docker Compose gives the user a false premise ofsomething that ""just works"" where it requires quite a deepunderstanding on how it works.When you get things wrong with Docker Compose, you often end upwith extremely confusing messages, that might suggest that theproblem is with Airflow, but really the problem is with how usersinteract with their custom Docker images, registries, pulling,networking, mounting volumes and plenty other things.While this is the same with Kubernetes and Helm Chart, Helm Chart makesit infinitely easier to customize in declarative way (this is whatour values.yaml does) and anything that has not been foreseen by HelmChart developers is ""hard"" by definition.Docker Compose makes no such distinction. You really can't make DockerCompose customizable by configuration, and any customization in itrequires modifying the compose file and for people who do not knowwhat they are doing will eventually lead to errors that they are notable to diagnose and leads to creation of ""Airlfow isssues"", where theyshould be brought to ""Docker Compose"" issues.Example of that is here: https://github.com/apache/airflow/discussions/22301where there are at least two issues that are not reproducible withoutknowing in detail what the user has done, how the image was buildand distributed, and how the docker-compose installation interactedwith them. This leads to a terrible distraction for supportingusers of Airflow as the issues are really Docker Compose issues andAirflow maintainers should not be involved in solving those.This PR adds a bit stronger language and statement about the scopeand customizability of the Quick Start Docker Compose of ours.

"[TIR] Prevent loop binding over-simplification (#11578)@vinx13 @jinhongyii and I observe a recent regression on TVM mainline: over-simplification in`Schedule.split` leads to information loss that negatively impacts search space generation.**Impact.** This affects common operators like `softmax` and even simpler reductions.**Example.** Consider splitting a simple reduction loop:```python@T.prim_funcdef main(    A: T.Buffer[2, ""float32""],    B: T.Buffer[2, ""float32""],    C: T.Buffer[(), ""float32""],) -> None:    for i in T.serial(2):  # <= split `i` into `i_0` and `i_1`, where `i_0` is a trivial loop        with T.block(""C""):            k = T.axis.reduce(2, i)            with T.init():                C[()] = T.float32(1)            C[()] = T.min(C[()], A[k] / B[k])```Splitting loop `i`  by factors `[1, 2]`, we get:```python@T.prim_funcdef main(    A: T.Buffer[2, ""float32""],    B: T.Buffer[2, ""float32""],    C: T.Buffer[(), ""float32""],) -> None:    for i_0, i_1 in T.grid(1, 2):        with T.block(""C""):            k = T.axis.reduce(2, i_1)  # <= i_0 is not part of the binding,                                       # so the system cannot tell if i_0 is a reduction loop            with T.init():                C[()] = T.float32(1)            C[()] = T.min(C[()], A[k] / B[k])```In this case, loop `i_0` will be considered as a spatial loop, even it’s the outcome of splittinga reduction loop. However, if we change the factors from `[1, 2]` to `[2, 1]`, loop `i_0` becomesa reduction loop. This means the loop iteration property depends on the loop extent.**Why is it problematic**? MetaSchedule has an assumption: extremely seldomly, a loop extent wouldimpact the iteration property of the loop itself, i.e. no matter the extent is 1 or 2 or anything,the fact that the loop is a reduction loop should rarely change.As an example, `Auto-Bind` finds the outer `k` spatial loops, which are fused together and bound tothread axis. In the trace, the number (`k`) of the outer loops has to be a constant.However, if Auto-Bind thinks there are `k=3` outer loops to fuse during search space generation,where the last loop happens to be a reduction loop with extent 1, as shown below:```pythonfor spatial_loop_0 in range(...):  for spatial_loop_1 in range(...):    for reduction_loop in range(1):  # <= Auto-Bind mistakes this loop as spatial, because extent==1```During evolutionary search, the extent of reduction_loop will change and become larger than 1.In this case, the binding strategy will consistently fail because it considers fusing `k=3` loops- which means the entire search strategy will fail with almost no valid candidates.Thanks @MasterJH5574 for figuring out the root cause of the issue,and @jinhongyii for valuable pointers to the right fix!",0

"Add a way to import Airflow without side-effects (#25832)I know it's been a long-standing issue that it should be possible to import Airflow as a library without side-effects, and while I think the ultimate fix for this is to go through and steadily remove the need to call `settings.initalize()` in `__init__.py`, I am currently working on a project where I would really like to use Airflow without it doing strange things to logging, sys.path, or atexit.As such, this PR wraps the import side-effect in a simple environment variable check that code can use to disable the side-effects for now, while we slowly try and progress towards a ""cleaner"" solution. Without this, I am having to dynamically modify the source code of `__init__.py` in an import hook, and nobody wants that!I don't believe it's possible to write tests for this as Airflow is already imported when tests are running, but if you can think of a way, let me know and I'll have a go. The environment variable name is also up for consideration - I just picked something that looked a bit like a setting, but we can deliberately make it not look like that if we want.",1

"Converts Dockerfiles to be standalone (#22492)This change is one of the biggest optimizations to the Dockerfilesthat from the very beginning was a goal, but it has been enabledby switching to buildkit and recent relase of support forthe 1.4 dockerfile syntax. This syntax introduced two features:* heredocs* links for COPY commandsBoth changes allows to solve multiple problems:* COPY for build scripts suffer from permission problems. Depending  on umask setting of the host, the scripts could have different  group permissions and invalidate docker cache. Inlining the  scripts (automatically by pre-commit) gets rid of the problem  completely* COPY --link allows to optimize and parallelize builds for  Dockerfile.ci embedded source code. This should speed up  not only building the images locally but also it will allow  to use more efficiently cache for the CI builds (in case no  source code change, the builds will use pre-cached layers from  the cache more efficiently (and in parallel)* The PROD Dockerfile is now completely standalone. You do not  need to have any folders or files to build Airlfow image. At  the same time the versatility and support for multiple ways  on how you can build the image (as described in  https://airflow.apache.org/docs/docker-stack/build.html is  maintained (this was a goal from the very beginning of the  PROD Dockerfile but it was not easily achievable - heredocs  allow to inline scripts that are used for the build and the  pre-commits will make sure that there is one source of truth  and nicely editable scripts for both PROD and CI Dockerfile.The last point is really cool, because it allows our users tobuild custom dockerfiles without checking out the code ofAirflow, it is enough to download the latest releasedDockerfile and they can easily build the image.Overall - this change will vastly optimize build speed forboth PROD and CI images in multiple scenarios.",4

Enables Kerberos sidecar support (#11130)Some of the users of Airflow are using Kerberos to authenticatetheir worker workflows.

The nicething about setting it up as a sidecar is that the Keytabis never shared with the workers - the secret is only mountedby the sidecar and the workers have only access to the temporarytoken.Depends on #11129,1

Later uses of conv2d in the tutorialspick that layout up then assert fail in the conv2d type-relation.Better would be to register a transform for an entirely fake target, butthat is beyond my current level of expertise.In general our use of sphinx/sphinx_gallery for running and rendering thetutorials is highly suspect since there is no inter-example isolation: - Examples using tensorflow will gobble up GPU memory and not give it back. - Any examples which use any of the (many!) global registration mechanisms   need to ensure the registrant is safe across all tutorials.I recall seeing a thread with the sphinx_gallery where they said they'd prefernot to work on process-level isolation, but it's probably worth pinging again.While digging into this I noticed we had a slicing cast in AlterOpLayout dueto a derived class of ObjectRef introducing virtuals. I moved the virtuals tothe corresponding Node classes. In this case we got away with it since theObjectRef happened to not get copied but we were on very thin ice.* [checkpoint] Woops, forgot there was an extra AlterOpLayoutI should have run locally, there goes 6hrs of CI.",1

"[CI] Remove `llvm -device=arm_cpu` and `cuda -libs=cudnn` from the default test target list (#10500)After recent improvement in GPU frontend tests, I found that `topi: GPU` has become a bottleneck. From the log https://ci.tlcpack.ai/blue/organizations/jenkins/tvm/detail/PR-10391/14/pipeline/319, it is clear that topi tests are running on target `llvm -device=arm_cpu` and `cuda -libs=cudnn`, which I claim is completely redundant since we already run on `llvm` and `cuda` targets. In https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9905, I've already removed them from `DEFAULT_TEST_TARGETS`, but `topi: GPU` uses its own list of targets which still includes `llvm -device=arm_cpu` and `cuda -libs=cudnn`.

"[AIRFLOW-2516] Fix mysql deadlocks (#6988)Deadlocks were occuring in mysql when task_instance was modifiedby two queries at the same time. One query used state as selectioncriteria and updated it in the same query where second query justupdated the state for the same table. The first query locked stateindex first and primary index afterwards, the second query lockedprimary index first and state afterwards - leading to deadlocks.This change splits the first query into two independent ones.First query makes select FOR UPDATE and selects all the taskinstances to act on (this will lock primary index only)and second updates all affected task instances.Note that performance impact for that is neglectable because thisquery is only run once every scheduler loop and the second partof it (looping through task instances) will only happen in casethere are some manually modified DagRun states - so it is onlyrun to correct some wrong states of DagRun. This should happenvery infrequently.",5

"Adds back documentation about context usage in Python/@task (#18868)There were many questions recently along the line of""How do I access context from TaskFlow task"". Surprisingly,the paragraph about accessing current context was removed fromthe ""Concepts"" (where it was there for Airflow 2.0.0) but wasnever added to the ""TaskFlow Tutorial"" where it actually belongs.Also Python Operator's description about passing contextvariables as kwargs have been removed when `provide_context`parameter was removed (it was only present in the docstringof `provide_context` and you could likely deduce this behaviourfrom several examples, but it was not mentioned anywhere.This PR adds the description with examples to the Python operatoras well as adds similar description in TaskFlow tutorial, includingthe possibility of using `get_current_context` deep down thestack to retrieve the context variables even if they are notpassed via kwargs.",4

"Initialize finished counter at zero (#23080)Sets initial count of task finished state to zero.This enables acquiring the rate from zero to one(particularly useful if you want to alert on any failures).We're using the Prometheus statsd-exporter. Since countersare usually used with a PromQL function like `rate`, it's importantthat counters are initialized at zero, otherwise when a taskfinishes the rate function will not have a previous value to comparethe state count to.For example, what we'd like to do:```sum by (dag_id, task_id) (rate(airflow_ti_finish{state='failed'}[1h])) >0```This tells us the failure rate of tasks over time.What I've tried to do instead to ensure the metric captures the changefrom zero to one:```(sum by (dag_id, task_id) (rate(airflow_ti_finish{state='failed'}[1h])) > 0) or sum by (dag_id, task_id) (airflow_ti_finish{state='failed'} != 0 unless (airflow_ti_finish{state='failed'} offset 1m))```Two useful posts on this subject:https://www.robustperception.io/why-predeclare-metricshttps://www.section.io/blog/beware-prometheus-counters-that-do-not-begin-at-zero/Co-authored-by: Bill Franklin <b.franklin@mwam.com>",2

"Fix rendering nested task fields (#18516)When we are referring ``{{task}}` in jinja templates we can alsorefer some of the fields, which are templated. We are notable to solve all the problems with such rendering (specificallyrecursive rendering of the fields used in JINJA templating mightbe problematic. Currently whether you see original, or renderedfield depends solely on the sequence in templated_fields.However that would not even explain the rendering problemdescribed in #13559 where kwargs were defined after opargs andthe rendering of opargs **should** work. It turned out thatthe problem was with a change introduced in #8805 which madethe context effectively holds a DIFFERENT task than the currentone. Context held an original task, and the curren task wasactually a locked copy of it (to allow resolving upstreamargs before locking). As a result, any changes done byrendering templates were not visible in the task accessedvia {{ task }} jinja variable.This change replaces the the task stored in context with thesame copy that is then used later during execution so thatat least the ""sequential"" rendering works and templatedfields which are 'earlier' in the list of templated fieldscan be used (and render correctly) in the following fields.Fixes: #13559",0
"[Hexagon] Add optimized schedule for nn.pad (#12714)Motivation:In case of quantized models nn.pad operation typically is not fused with QNN opsand lives as a standalone operation. In this case it uses default injectiveschedule for Hexagon target and it is not optimized very well (based onanalysis of real models like ResNet50 INT8).What was done:New schedule for Pad operation was implemented instead of default injective schedule.For Hexagon target injective schedule does fusion of all axis and vectorizationon 128/64/32 (depends on dtype). It works fine for Add, Sub, etc... but not for Pad.New optimized schedule does these steps (fusion+vectorization) only if last tensordimension is divisible by 128/64/32 (depends on dtype). It was done only for Hexagon,for other targets (x86, cuda, etc.) there is no changes and it uses default injectiveschedule.Benchmark results on Snapdragon 888:4d NHWC layout with ((0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 1), (0, 0)) padding, ""uint8"" dtype:shape              | default schedule, ms | optimized schedule, ms |      speedup      |-------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|(1, 112, 112, 32)  |         10,03        |           0.2          |    50.1x times    |(1, 56, 56, 128)   |         0,099        |          0,085         |  ~1x (no speedup) |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|4d NCHW layout with ((0, 0), (0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 1)) padding, ""uint8"" dtype:shape              | default schedule, ms | optimized schedule, ms |      speedup      |-------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|(1, 128, 56, 56)   |         10.96        |          1.38          |    7.9x times     |(1, 32, 126, 126)  |          1.66        |          1.58          |  ~1x (no speedup) |(1, 32, 128, 128)  |         13.98        |          2.66          |    5.25x times    |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|5d NCHWc layout with ((0, 0), (0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 1), (0, 0)) padding, ""uint8"" dtype:shape              | default schedule, ms | optimized schedule, ms |      speedup      |-------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|(1, 4, 56, 56, 32) |          6.39        |          0.29          |     22x times     |(1, 56, 56, 128)   |          0.15        |          0.15          |  ~1x (no speedup) |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|Summary:For some input tensors we get up to 50x times speedup, for other performance is the same.No performance degradations were detected.",5

"Add extra sync when adding executable flag to installation scripts (#20987)Seems that when AUFS is a backing storage for Docker, changingthe script to executable and executing it right after during thebuild phase might cause an error: 'text file busy'https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/13594Workaround for that is to add extra `sync` command after changingthe executable flag to make sure that the filesystem change haspropageted to the underlying AUFS storage.This PR adds the sync and also makes sure that both CI And PRODimage use same formatting, executable bits and `&&` betweencommands rather than `;`. The `&&` is better to separate thecommands because it will not continue with execution steps in thesame bash command after previous command fails. This causedconfusion as to what is the reason for docker build failure.The problem was raised in the #20971 discussion.",0

They used to be needed whenwe built the Kubernetes image in the container, but sincewe are now using production image directly - we do not needthem any nmore.Combining setting the default strategy to local and removingthe Dockerfile from the context has the nice effect that youcan iterate much faster on the Production image withouttriggering rebuilds of half of the docker imageas soon as the Dockerfile changes.",4

"Explain scheduler fine-tuning better (#18356)* Explain scheduler fine-tuning betterA lot of users have an expectations that Airflow Scheduler will`just work` and deliver the `optimal performance` for them withoutrealising that in case of such comples systems as Airflow is youoften have to decide what you should optimise for or accept sometrade-offs or increase hardware capacity if you are not willing tomake those trade-offs.Also it's not clear where the responsibilityis - should it `just work` or should the user be responsible forunderstanding and fine tuning their system (both approaches arepossible, there are some complex systmes which utilise a lot ofautomation/AI etc. to fine tune and optmise their behaviour butAirflow expects from the users to know a bit more on how thescheduling works and Airflow maintainers deliver a lot ofknobs that can be turned to fine tune the system and to maketrade-off decisions. This was not explicitely stated in ourdocumentation and users could have different expectations aboutit (and they often had judging from issues they raised).This PR adds a ""fine-tuning"" chapter that aims to set theexpectations of the users at the right level - it explains whatAirflow provides, but also what is the user's responsibility - todecide what they are optimising, to see where their bottlenecksare and to decide if they need to change the configuration orincrease hardware capacity (or make appropriate trade-offs).It also brings more of the fine-tuning parameters to the`tuneables` section of scheduler, based on some of the recentquestions asked by the users - seems that having a specificoverview of all performance-impacting parameters is a good idea,and we only had a very limited subset of those.Some user prefer `watch` rather than read that's why this PRalso adds the link to the recording of talk from theAirlfow Summit 2021 where Ash describes - in a very conciseand easy to grasp way - all the whys and hows of the scheduler.If you understand why and how the scheduler does what it does,fine-tuning decisions are much easier.* fixup!

"[Metaschedule] Add test case for multi-anchor subgraph (#10856)This adds a demonstration of extracting, scheduling, and e2e-compiling relay subgraphs with multiple anchor ops.

We insteadhave to call `poll()` through `BaseProcess`'s `_popen`attribute.* Prevent static check from failingAfter reading through `multiprocessing`'s implementation wereally didn't know why the static check on line `239` wasfailing: the process should contain a `_popen` attribute...That's when we found line `223` and discovered the trailing`# type: ignore` comment. After reading up on it we foundthat it instructs *MyPy* not to statically check that veryline. Given we're having trouble with the exact same attributewe decided to include the same directive for the static checker.Hope we made the right call!* Fix test for `_kill_timed_out_processors()`We hadn't updated the tests for the method whosebody we've altered. This caused the tests to failwhen trying to retrieve a processor's *waitable*,a property similar to a *file descriptor* inUNIX-like systems. We have added a mock property tothe `processor` and we've also updated the `manager`'sattributes so as to faithfully recreate the state ofthe data sctructures at a moment when a `processor`is to be terminated.Please note the `assertions` at the end are meant tocheck we reach the `manager`'s expected state. We havechosen to check the number of processor's against anexplicit value because we're defining `manager._processors`explicitly within the test. On the other hand, `manager.waitables`can have a different length depending on the call to`DagFileProcessorManager`'s `__init__()`. In this test theexpected initial length is `1` given we're passing `MagicMock()`as the `signal_conn` when instantiating the manager. However,if this were to be changed the tests would 'inexplicably' fail.Instead of checking `manager.waitables`' length against a hardcodedvalue we decided to instead compare it to its initial lengthso as to emphasize we're interested in the change in length, notits absolute value.* Fix `black` checks and `mock` decoratorsOne of the methods we are to mock required a ratherlong `@mock.patch` decorator which didn't pass thechecks made by `black` on the precommit hooks. Ontop of that, we messed up the ordering of the`@mock.patch` decorators which meant we didn'tset them up properly. This manifested as a `KeyError`on the method we're currently testing.

"[µTVM] Add support for mps2_an521 board (#7813)* [µTVM] Zephyr: Allow user inform if a board is emulatedSome boards supported by Zephyr that run emulated by default, i.e. their.yaml config file sets the field ""simulation: qemu"", don't have theprefix ""qemu_"" on their names, so µTVM can't currently recognize it asan emulated target to properly use the QEMU transporter (instead of theserial port) to open a session against it. Such a boards usually havereal physical (hardware) counterparts, being specific boards and notgeneric or ""fake"" ones simply tied to a CPU type of interest.That commit allows the µTVM user to explicitly inform that µTVM needsto use the QEMU transporter to open a session against a given board byadding the suffix ""-qemu"" to the board name. That is necessary becausefor boards that don't have the name prefixed by ""qemu_"" and even thoughrun emulated by default on Zephyr there is no easy way to detect them,since it's not possible to determine it by looking at any Cmakegenerated file or by using the `west` command to query that info.The case where the board is emulated by default but has the prefix""qemu_"" in its board name is already handled by the current code.Signed-off-by: Gustavo Romero <gustavo.romero@linaro.org>* [µTVM] Add new target mps2_an521This commit adds a new µTVM target to support the Arm reference boardMPS2-AN521, which is based upon a Cortex-m33 core.For more details about that board, please see:http://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/development-boards/fpga-prototyping-boards/mps2Signed-off-by: Gustavo Romero <gustavo.romero@linaro.org>* [µTVM] Add an example for the mps2_an521 boardThis commit adds an example on how to run the Zephyr demo under apps/using as a target the Arm mps2_an521 board, which is emulated by defaulton Zephyr.

The change explicitly specifies whichof the mounts are bind mounts and which are volume mounts.Another nice side effect of this change is that when source ismissing, docker will not automatically create directories with themissing name but it will fail. This is nicer because before itled to creating directories when they were missing (for example.bash_aliases and similar).

Even when we pass our parameters sucess_states and pipeline_timeout we get this error in this case, so I think when I pass both parameters the logic should use them not default. Why we have 300 second and these SUCCESS_STATES + [PipelineStates.RUNNING], because we had these values in the wait_for_pipeline_state call which I removed from hook, I think we should replace this 300 second and use default value from __init__ method (this is a open question I think)",5

"[microNPU] Fix incorrectly calculated stride when converting NHWC to NHCWB16 (#9560)Fixes an issue that causes strides to be incorrectly calculated when thenumber of channels in the input is less than 16 and involves a conversionfrom NHWC to NHCWB16. This is due to TVM being 'too smart' when analyzinggenerated TE and removing compute that is deemed unnecessary. Consequently,strides over data are incorrectly calculated leading to an outputmismatch.The PR uses a reduce sum operation to trick TE's data dependencyanalyzer into looping over a whole block (16), rather than the numberof channels actually used (< 16). This causes the calculated strides tobe a multiple of 16 which is required for NHCWB16 format.Change-Id: Ibf76a94a12cebf51fa716fcac1de932a271c4a6d",4

The destructor sends a RPCCode::kFreeHandle packet withtype_code = kTVMModuleHandle to the device which wipes entries incrt/src/runtime/crt/common/crt_runtime_api.c:147:static const TVMModule*registered_modules[TVM_CRT_MAX_REGISTERED_MODULES] when TVMFreeMod() iscalled when the target receives a kFreeHandle packet.Hence when one tries to re-run a model registered_modules[0] == NULLcauses a backtrace on the host side. Probably never before a model onmicroTVM was run without being flashed just before the run, so tvmc runimplementation for micro targets exposed the issue.This commit fixes it by not calling TVMFreeMod() for system_lib_handleon the target side when a session terminates so the pointer to thesystem_lib_handle is not flushed from 'registered_modules', allowingmultiple runs on micro targets.Signed-off-by: Gustavo Romero <gustavo.romero@linaro.org>* [TVMC] Pass main parser when calling add_*_parser functionsCurrently when a add_*_parser functions are called in main.py to buildand add the various subparsers to the main parser only a subparser ispassed to the functions. However if one of these functions need to builda dynamic parser it needs also to call the main parser at least once toparse once the command line and get the arguments necessary to finallybuild the complete parser.This commit fixes that limitation by passing also the main parser whencalling the subparser builders so it can be used to build the dynamicsubparses.Signed-off-by: Gustavo Romero <gustavo.romero@linaro.org>* [TVMC] micro: Add new micro contextThis commit introduces support for micro targets (targets supported bymicroTVM). It creates a new micro context under the new TVMC command'tvmc micro'. Moreover, three new subcommands are made available in thenew context under 'tvmc micro': 'create-project', 'build', and 'flash'.The new support relies on the Project API to query all the optionsavailable for a selected platform (like Zephyr and Arduino) and alsofrom any adhoc platform template directory which provides a customProject API server.Signed-off-by: Gustavo Romero <gustavo.romero@linaro.org>* [TVMC] run: Add support for micro devicesAdd support for micro devices using the Project API to query all optionsavailable for a given platform and open a session with an specifiedmicro device.

"Speed up clear_task_instances by doing a single sql delete for TaskReschedule (#14048)Clearing large number of tasks takes a long time. Most of the time is spent at this line in clear_task_instances (more than 95% time).

It's effectively doing the same, but now it's much faster. Some profiling showed great speed improvement (something like 40 to 50 times faster) compared to the first iteration.

"[REFACTOR][TE][TIR] Call::Halide => ProducerLoad, DSL/TIR decouple. (#5743)In the HalideIR's design, DSL components and IR are mixed together.For example, Call::Halide can containa reference to a function which isconstructed in the tensor expression language.While this coupled design simplifies certain aspect of the DSL construction,it prevents the TIR to evolve as a clean standalone IR:- The additional tensor expression provided in the function is opaque to the IR  and may become obsolete as we transform them.- The duplication of the information in the DSL tensor and IR makes it hard to  design a stand-alone text format (when there are elements shared in the tensor  expression and normal statements).This PR aims to clearly de-couple the TIR from high-level DSL structures(tensor expression),while still provide clear extensions to build DSLs on top of the TIR.We introduce a DataProducer as a base class for high level tensor expressions objectsthat produce data. We then introduce ProducerLoad to replace the Call::Halide usage,so that the Call node can always be self contained and used for low-level calls.The high-level tensor expression DSL can still generate a PrimExpr that contains a ProducerLoad.These PrimExprs contains fragments of information that can be combined together togenerate a low-level TIR PrimFunc.We also state clearly that DataProducer **should not** appear in any TIR PrimFunc.Instead, the high-level DSL layer should lowered DataProducers to Buffers and TIR statementsthat produces these buffers. We can further provide verifications to validate such invariance.Changes:- Introduce DataProducer to serve as a base class for Tensor in tensor expressions.- Migrate use of Call::Halide to ProducerLoad- Migrate the other usages of Calls.We will also create follow-up PRs to migrate the remaining two DSL related IR nodes(Realize/Provide)to use the DataProducer.",5

"[AIRFLOW-1398] Allow ExternalTaskSensor to wait on multiple runs of a taskCurrently using the execution_date_fn parameter ofthe ExternalTaskSensorsensors only allows to wait for the completion ofone given run of thetask the ExternalTaskSensor is sensing.However, this prevents users to have setups wheredags don't have the sameschedule frequency but still depend on oneanother. For example, let's sayyou have a dag scheduled hourly that transformslog data and is owned bythe team in charge of logging. In the currentsetup you cannot have otherhigher level teams, that want to use thistransformed data, createdags processing transformed log data in dailybatches, while making surethe logged transformed data was properly created.Note that simply waiting for the data to bepresent (using e.g. theHivePartitionSensor if the data is in hive) mightnot be satisfactorybecause the data being present doesn't mean it isready to be used.This commit makes it possible to do exactly thatby being able to havean ExternalTaskSensor wait for multiple runs ofthe task it is sensing tohave finished. Now higher level teams can setupdags with anExternalTaskSensor sensing the end task of the dagthat transforms thelog data and waiting for the successful completionof 24 of its hourly runs.Closes #2431 from rlk-ama/pr/multiple-dates-external-task-sensor",5
