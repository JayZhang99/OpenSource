Issue #3142 - Filters on-canvas preview doesn't work ...... immediately after an image precision changeWhen flushing a projection, make sure it has a buffer, instead ofbailing if it doesn't.

Issue #3493: GIMP changes R-channel, when it should not.Our TIFF loading code was not taking into account the case when extrachannels were stored in the TIFF file while ExtraSamples field is notset. Yet as a side effect of a later channel count, we were setting`alpha` to TRUE while `save_transp_pixels` was left uninitialized (henceundefined behavior).For now let's make sure we have no undefined behavior. When theExtraSamples field is missing and at least one extra channel is stored,we will consider the first extra channel as non-premultiplied alpha(this is also what we were doing when ExtraSamples was set to"Unspecified data" and apparently according to Massimo, it would be acommon behavior in other software).Note that it is an improvement from previous code (no undefinedbehaviour anymore, instead we handle explicitly the TIFF error). Yetthis is not perfect yet. Ideally we should pop-up a dialog asking whatto do with this extra channel: either open as a channel (no alpha), oras premultiplied or non-premultiplied alpha.	2

Fix race condition when flake checks run in parallel (#20294)The Flake checks run in parallel and when you had an image whichrequired rebuild, it performed additional check on whether theimage needs build or "pull+build". When it was run in parallela temporary file containing hash of the remote image could beoverwritten and emptied while another process was reading itwhich resulted in error when running flake command.This has been changed - the files are now stored in a temporaryfiles - unique to each of the processes running in parallel andthe file in question is moved as an atomic operation so it willnever become empty.	4

MINOR: Add HostedPartition.Deferred state in ReplicaManager (#10003)Brokers receive metadata from the Raft metadata quorum very differently than they do fromZooKeeper today, and this has implications for ReplicaManager.  In particular, when a brokerreads the metadata log it may not arrive at the ultimate state for a partition until it reads multiplemessages.  In normal operation the multiple messages associated with a state change will allappear in a single batch, so they can and will be coalesced and applied together.  There arecircumstances where messages associated with partition state changes will appear acrossmultiple batches and we will be forced to coalesce these multiple batches together.  Thecircumstances when this occurs are as follows:- When the broker restarts it must "catch up" on the metadata log, and it is likely that thebroker will see multiple partition state changes for a single partition across differentbatches while it is catching up.  For example, it will see the `TopicRecord` and the`PartitionRecords` for the topic creation, and then it will see any `IsrChangeRecords`that may have been recorded since the creation.  The broker does not know the state ofthe topic partitions until it reads and coalesces all the messages.- The broker will have to "catch up" on the metadata log if it becomes fenced and thenregains its lease and resumes communication with the metadata quorum.- A fenced broker may ultimately have to perform a "soft restart" if it was fenced for solong that the point at which it needs to resume fetching the metadata log has beensubsumed into a metadata snapshot and is no longer independently fetchable.  A softrestart will entail some kind of metadata reset based on the latest available snapshotplus a catchup phase to fetch after the snapshot end point.The first case -- during startup -- occurs before clients are able to connect to the broker.Clients are able to connect to the broker in the second case.  It is unclear if clients will beable to to connect to the broker during a soft restart (the third case).We need a way to defer the application of topic partition metadata in all of the above cases,and while we are deferring the application of the metadata the broker will not service clientsfor the affected partitions.As a side note, it is arguable if the broker should be able to service clients while catching upor not.  The decision to not service clients has no impact in the startup case -- clients can'tconnect yet at that point anyway.  In the third case it is not yet clear what we are going to do,but being unable to service clients while performing a soft reset seems reasonable.  In thesecond case it is most likely true that we will catch up quickly; it would be unusual toreestablish communication with the metadata quorum such that we gain a new lease andbegin to catch up only to lose our lease again.So we need a way to defer the application of partition metadata and make those partitionsunavailable while deferring state changes.  This PR adds a new internal partition state toReplicaManager to accomplish this.  Currently the available partition states are simple`Online`, `Offline` (meaning a log dir failure) and `None` (meaning we don't know about it). We add a new `Deferred` state.  We also rename a couple of methods that refer to"nonOffline" partitions to instead refer to "online" partitions.**The new `Deferred` state never happens when using ZooKeeper for metadata storage.**Partitions can only enter the `Deferred` state when using a KIP-500 Raft metadata quorumand one of the above 3 cases occurs.  The testing strategy is therefore to leverage existingtests to confirm that there is no functionality change in the ZooKeeper case.  We will addthe logic for deferring/applying/reacting to deferred partition state in separate PRs sincethat code will never be invoked in the ZooKeeper world.Reviewers: Jason Gustafson <jason@confluent.io>, Ismael Juma <ismael@juma.me.uk>	5

Fix race condition when starting DagProcessorAgent (#19935)As described in detail in #19860, there was a race condition instarting and terminating DagProcessorAgent that caused us a lotof headeaches with flaky test_scheduler_job failures on our CIand after long investigation, it turned out to be a racecondition. Not very likely, but possible to happen in production.The race condition involved starting DagProcessorAgent viamultiprocessing, where the first action of the agent was changingthe process GID to be the same as PID. If the DagProcessorAgentwas terminated quickly (on a busy system) before the processcould change the GID, the `reap_process_group` that was supposedto kill the whole group, was failing and the DagProcessorAgentremained running.This problem revealed a wrong behaviour of Airflow in some edgeconditions when 'spawn' mode was used for starting the DAG processorDetails are described in #19934, but this problem will have to besolved differently (avoiding ORM reinitialization during DAGprocessor starting).This change also moves the tests for `spawn` method out fromtest_scheduler_job.py (it was a remnant of old Airlfow and itdid not really test what it was supposed to test). Instead testswere added for different spawn modes and killing the processoragent in both spawn and "default" mode.	1

Bug 795855 - File chooser dialogs do not show folders or files for...... drive roots (e.g. C:\, D:\, ...))This is a regression of glib 2.56 (not applying to 2.54 since it is newcode). It has been fixed recently in what will be 2.56.2 but is notreleased yet, so we can't just bump the requirement.Since it is a pretty bad bug though, let's add a test specifically forthese versions in the configure script so that nobody will package theseversions of glib.

HOTFIX: Use atomic boolean for inject errors in streams eos integration testOriginally we assume the task will be created exactly three times (twice upon starting up, once for each thread, and then one more time when rebalancing upon the thread failure). However there is a likelihood that upon starting up more than one rebalance will be triggered, and hence the tasks will be initialized more than 3 times, i.e. there will be more than three hashcodes of the `Transformer` object, causing the `errorInjected` to never be taken and exception never thrown.The current fix is to use an atomic boolean instead and let threads compete on compare-and-set to make sure exactly one thread will throw exception, and will only throw once.Without this patch I can reproduce the issue on my local machine with a single core ever 3-5 times; with this patch I have been running successfully for 10+ runs.Ping mjsax ijuma for reviews.Author: Guozhang Wang <wangguoz@gmail.com>Reviewers: Matthias J.

libgimpwidgets: improve/fix more of GimpMemSizeEntry.Looking further at this widget, many things are not right. Here are thechanges:- Use binary prefixes (i.e. kibibyte, mebibyte and gibibyte) instead of  decimal ones. We are making binary shifts so we were actually showing  the wrong units.- Round the value to the closest integer when showing it, not towards 0.  Otherwise I had cases where it was showing 7GiB for an actual value of  7.69GiB (default as computed by GIMP from my actual physical memory).  Note that I am actually unsure even rounding makes sense. Shouldn't we  rather show double values with a few digits after the decimal points?  For such values, I think it would make sense.- Do not edit the internally saved accurate value when the entry is  edited to the same less accurate value as our saved value would be  shown too. In particular when changing the display unit to a bigger  one, we don't want to lose accuracy. This is especially true for low  values. Say you don't have a lot of memory and you set the Tile cache  size to 1.5GiB (1536MiB), you certainly don't want it to become either  1 or 2GiB when switching display unit to GiB. Now even if the number  will still display with less accuracy, the internal value will stay  accurate.	1

[AIRFLOW-738] Commit deleted xcom items before insertA delete insert sequence within one transaction can leadto a deadlocked transaction with Mariadb / MySQL.The deletes, in case they affected no rows, all get a shared lock(mode IX) on the end-of-table gap. Once the insert is executed,the shared lock is still held by all threads,and the insert intention waits for the release of this shared lock.The solution is to not do the following in parallel:1. Delete the rows you want to insert, when the rows aren't there.2. Insert the rowsIn this case the risk of not executing the delete and insertis relatively low, as it was the users intention to run thetask. In case it fails in between the two transactionsthe task can be tried.	0

[hotfix] [network] Release unpooled buffer for events.So far, these buffers never needed to be released, because they do not come from a buffer pool.They were simply garbage collected.When changing the blocking partitions to use memory mapped files, these buffer were referingfor a short time to an unmapped memory region (after the partition is released). Because the bufferswere not accessed any more by any code, it did not matter when regularly running Flink.But, it did segfault the JVM when attaching a debugger and exploring just that part of the code.This happens because the debugger calls toString() on the buffer object as part of its rendering of the currentstack frame. The toString() method access the buffer contents, which is an unmapped region of memory,and boom!	0

plug-ins: break "pixel-format" arg with 2 new args: "data-type" and…… "endianness".The list of formats being a single list was actually interestingUI-wise, in the case where you aren't sure of the data layout (but sayyou know at least the dimensions), you can easily and quickly scrollthrough the combo list (e.g. with keyboard arrows).But when you knew your data, it was a pain to use. And as a generalrule, so many choices in a list is not the best interface.I broke the option into 3 options, and in particular adding a"data-type" which would tell what type of values are stored (integer,signed or unsigned, or float) and an "endianness" to tell the byteorder. The idea behind is that these don't change the layout ofcomponents and their size. It means that we can still do thescrolling-randomly-through-formats trick in some fashion because wemight likely be able to detect shapes when we get at the right layout,even though we are still set to use the wrong data type and/or the wrongendianness.	0

KAFKA-9231: Streams Threads may die from recoverable errors with EOS enabled (#7748)Fix three independent causes of threads dying:1. `ProducerFencedException` isn't properly handed while suspending a task, and leads to the thread dying.2. `IllegalStateException`: an internal assertion is violated because a store can get orphaned when an exception is thrown during initialization, again leading to the thread dying.3. `UnknownProducerIdException`: This exception isn't expected by the Streams code, so when we get it, the relevant thread dies. It's not clear whether we always need to catch this, and in the future, we won't expect it at all, but we are catching it now to be sure we're resilient if/when it happens. Important note: this might actually harm performance if the errors turn out to be ignorable, and we will now rebalance instead of ignoring them.Also, add missing test coverage for the exception handling code.Reviewers: Boyang Chen <boyang@confluent.io>, Matthias J.

Split tests to more sub-types (#11402)We seem to have a problem with running all tests at once - mostlikely due to some resource problems in our CI, therefore it makessense to split the tests into more batches. This is not yet fullimplementation of selective tests but it is going in this directionby splitting to Core/Providers/API/CLI tests. The full selectivetests approach will be implemented as part of #10507 issue.This split is possible thanks to #10422 which moved building imageto a separate workflow - this way each image is only built onceand it is uploaded to a shared registry, where it is quicklydownloaded from rather than built by all the jobs separately - thisway we can have many more jobs as there is very little per-joboverhead before the tests start runnning.	1

The record scan in the old code ensured thatempty record batches were never down-converted, which hid this bug.* upgrade_test: set the IBP 2.8 when message format is < 0.11 to ensure we areactually writing with the old message format even though the test was passingwithout the change.Verified with ducker that some variants of these tests failed without these changesand passed with them. Also added a unit test for the down-conversion bug fix.Reviewers: Jason Gustafson <jason@confluent.io>	5

app: add "Snap brush outline to stroke" option to the preferencesAdd a new "Snap brush outline to stroke" toggle to the "ImageWindows" preferences page.  When enabled, the brush outline inpaint tools snaps to the individual dabs while painting, instead offollowing the cursor precisely (this is the existing behavior).When disabled, the brush outline follows the cursor while paintingin the same way it does while not painting.Disable the option by default.  This seems to be what most otherprograms are doing, and it does give paitning a smoother feel.	0

KAFKA-5269; Retry on unknown topic/partition error in transactional requestsWe should retry AddPartitionsToTxnRequest and TxnOffsetCommitRequest when receiving an UNKNOWN_TOPIC_OR_PARTITION error.As described in the JIRA: It turns out that the `UNKNOWN_TOPIC_OR_PARTITION` is returned from the request handler in KafkaAPis for the AddPartitionsToTxn and the TxnOffsetCommitRequest when the broker's metadata doesn't contain one or more partitions in the request. This can happen for instance when the broker is bounced and has not received the cluster metadata yet.We should retry in these cases, as this is the model followed by the consumer when committing offsets, and by the producer with a ProduceRequest.Author: Apurva Mehta <apurva@confluent.io>Reviewers: Guozhang Wang <wangguoz@gmail.com>, Jason Gustafson <jason@confluent.io>Closes #3094 from apurvam/KAFKA-5269-handle-unknown-topic-partition-in-transaction-manager	0

Breeze help images are now consistently generated in pre-commit (#26032)Images generated for Breeze Help can slightly differ, however wewant them to be generated always consistently. Therefore the imagesare now (when using pre-commit) generated inside the CI image ratherthan locally.This change also introduces much more selective image generationwhich will make the image generation much faster in case youchange any of breeze code. Previously, any change in any breezecommand parameters triggered regeneration of the images.With this change, only those commands that get changed getregenerated (and information about which images need to be regeneratedis printed).This change removes one of the Breeze setup commands - the hashgeneration - as it is now done internally by the regenerate commandand does not need to be externalized (--check-only) flag providesa way how to check if breeze images need regeneration.	1

plug-ins: avoid running pygimp plug-ins derived from gimpplugin.plugin at each startupWhen initializing a pygimp plug-in derived from gimpplugin.plugin,only pass the plug-in's init() and quit() functions to gimp.main()if the plug-in actually implements them, instead of passing thedefault NOP versions.  This avoids plug-ins that don't implementinit() from being registered as having an init function, causingthem to be run at each startup.	1

Bug 781621 - PDB shapeburst gradient is slower than the blend tool.PDB function gimp_edit_blend() was based on "gimp:shapeburst" operationwhereas the rest of GIMP (in particular, the Blend tool) used"gegl:distance-transform" which is much faster.Setting the operation to "manhattan" metric ensures that it stillrenders the same way as in 2.8 while being a lot faster.There was still a problem regarding as how it renders differently fromthe Blend tool, but it turns out that the Blend tool is the onerendering differently from how it used to in 2.8. We should discussadding the "metric" property in the tool options.	5

Gracefully handle missing start_date and end_date for DagRun (#14452)closes: #14384This PR fixes two issues:1) A TypeError that would be raised from _emit_duration_stats_for_finished_state() when the scheduler transitions a DagRun from a running state into a success or failed state if the DagRun did not have a start_date or end_date set.2) An issue with the DagRunEditForm, which would clear the start_date and end_date for a DagRun, if the form was used to transition a DagRun from a failed state back into a running state (or any other state). In the event where the scheduler would determine the DagRun should've been in the failed or success state (e.g. because the task instances weren't cleared), then this would lead to a scheduler crash.	1

libgimp: procedure's arguments labels are now localized plug-in side.Continuing the changes in #8124, let's have properties labels and blurbsboth localized on plug-in code, i.e. with gettext calls directly inGIMP_PROC_ARG_*() calls.Note that it was already the case for blurbs (longer description,tooltip) as I couldn't find code where we'd localize it further down theline. But we were running gettext on nicks (shorter description, label)inside GimpProcedureDialog code. Let's not do this anymore.This will make the whole localization much more clear and obvious. Thereis no "later localized" case anymore. Now let's localize everythingdirectly when the arguments are created.	1

Filter out non-editable apache-airflow from constraints. (#25847)The constraint files should not contain apache-airflow. So farapache-airflow has been automatically filtered out by the fact that ithas been an editable installation and we filtered out all editableand file installations from `pip freeze`.However as of ~12 August 2022, likely setuptools change triggereda slight behaviour change when `eager-upgrade` installation ofproviders from PyPi was run in the CI image. Previously airflowremained an editable install, but as of 12th of August, such aninstallation causes removal of editable airlfow install andreinstalls it in non-editable mode. While this change is somewhatconfusing, we have to protect against it and remove apache-airflowfrom `pip freeze` also in non-editable mode.	2

MINOR: Fix DescribeLogDirs API error handling for older API versions (#12017)With KAFKA-13527 / KIP-784 we introduced a new top-level error code forthe DescribeLogDirs API for versions 3 and above. However, the changeregressed the error handling for versions less than 3 since the responseconverter fails to write the non-zero error code out (rightly) forversions lower than 3 and drops the response to the client whicheventually times out instead of receiving an empty log dirs response andprocessing that as a Cluster Auth failure.With this change, the API conditionally propagates the error code out tothe client if the request API version is 3 and above. This keeps thesemantics of the error handling the same for all versions and restoresthe behavior for older versions.See current behavior in the broker log:```bashERROR] 2022-04-08 01:22:56,406 [data-plane-kafka-request-handler-10] kafka.server.KafkaApis - [KafkaApi-0] Unexpected error handling request RequestHeader(apiKey=DESCRIBE_LOG_DIRS, apiVersion=0, clientId=sarama, correlationId=1) -- DescribeLogDirsRequestData(topics=null)org.apache.kafka.common.errors.UnsupportedVersionException: Attempted to write a non-default errorCode at version 0[ERROR] 2022-04-08 01:22:56,407 [data-plane-kafka-request-handler-10] kafka.server.KafkaRequestHandler - [Kafka Request Handler 10 on Broker 0], Exception when handling requestorg.apache.kafka.common.errors.UnsupportedVersionException: Attempted to write a non-default errorCode at version 0```Reviewers: Ismael Juma <ismael@juma.me.uk>	0

Don't use author_association for self-hosted vs public runner decision. (#14718)Using this has two draw-backs for us.1. MEMBER applies to _anyone in the org_, not just members/commiters to   this repo2. The value of this setting depends upon the user's "visiblity" in the   org. I.e. if they hide their membership of the org, the   author_association will show up as "CONTRIBUTOR" instead.Both of these combined mean we should instead use an alternative list.We can't use a secret as the `secrets.` context is not available in the runs-onstanza, so we have to have a hard-coded list in the workflow file :( This is assecure as the runner still checks the author against it's own list.	1

[TESTS] Improve script robustness (#2893)A number of test scripts use the '|| exit 1' idiom.  This has twoissues, first process exit codes are defined to be in the range 0-255.Second, more importantly, the idiom is fragile because it requiresthat every possible failure point be explicitly coded.  This patchremoves the idiom in favour of "set -e" as used in the docker scriptsas a more robust mechanism to ensure that script failures are alwayscaught and propagated by default.	0

A finite retention period defines how long records will be kept, ie the window of time for fetching, and the grace period defines the window within which late-arriving data may still be written to the store.Unit tests were written to test the functionality of the window store, including its insert/update/delete and fetch operations. Single-record, all records, and range fetch were tested, for both time ranges and key ranges. The logging and metrics for late-arriving (dropped)records were tested as well as the ability to restore from a changelog.Reviewers: John Roesler <john@confluent.io>, Matthias J.

Why do we care that a translatable string iswritten in this or that language? All our plug-ins should just share acommon text domain. This way, we avoid useless duplication of commonstrings.	1

KAFKA-13417; Ensure dynamic reconfigurations set old config properly (#11448)This patch fixes a bug in `DynamicBrokerConfig` which causes some configuration changes to be ignored. In particular, the bug is the result of the reference to the old configuration getting indirectly mutated prior to the call to `BrokerReconfigurable.reconfigure`. This causes the first dynamic configuration update to pass effectively the same configuration as both `oldConfig` and `newConfig`. In cases such as in `DynamicThreadPool`, the update is ignored because the old configuration value matches the new configuration value.This bug only affects KRaft. It is protected in the zk broker by the call to `DynamicBrokerConfig.initialize()`, which overwrites the stored reference to the original configuration. The patch fixes the problem by ensuring that `initialize()` is also invoked in KRaft when `BrokerServer` starts up.Reviewers: David Jacot <djacot@confluent.io>, Rajini Sivaram <rajinisivaram@googlemail.com>	5

Bug 787457 - Paint brush settings display system language (e.g. zh_TW)... and ignore language setting (e.g. en_US).The problem came from the fact that these settings names are classproperties of GimpPaintOptions/GimpContext which is first instanciatedwhen the Gimp object is created. This unfortunately happened beforelanguage_init() since we needed these objects when loading gimprc(making inversion of calls rather complicated).Therefore they were localized with the system language, not theconfigured language.The solution was to create a very simple object GimpLangRC whichimplements the GimpConfig interface, for sole purpose to read thelanguage from `gimprc` in a first pass. gimp_load_config() will stillhappen later as a second pass to properly load the rest of theconfiguration.	5

Thisallows to reuse them across multiple JobManagerRunners.The RpcEndpoint#postStop method is now called by the UntypedActor#postStop method,which ensures that the RpcEndpoint's method is also called if only the underlyingRpcService is shut down (without explicitly shutting down the RpcEndpoint).This closes #4596.	1

Bug 736907 - Compat mode for XCF- add gimp_image_get,get_xcf_compat_mode()- add a compat toggle to GimpFileDialog which is shown and sensitive  only for a save (not export), and if the image structure allows  to save an old version at all. The button also has a tooltip  which explains why it is sensitive and what it does- add "gboolean xcf_compat" to file_save_dialog_save_image()- in file_save_dialog_save_image(), call image_set_xcf_compat_mode(TRUE)  only around the call to file_save() and set it to FALSE after saving- in xcf_save_invoker(), honor the image's XCF compat flag and save an  RLE-compressed XCF if possibleThe above is very convoluted and doesn't pass the "xcf_compat" booleandirectly because we can't change the parameters of gimp-xcf-save, andbecause the gimp-xcf-save might be called indirectly.	5

app, autotools, meson: new GIMP_RELEASE macro.We were using GIMP_UNSTABLE extensively to differentiate developmentfrom stable code. But there is actually another level of developmentcode. Basically GIMP_UNSTABLE tells you are on the development branch,e.g. for current branches, that you are on 2.99.* versions (vs. 2.10).This depends on the minor version oddness.GIMP_RELEASE will tell you if it's a release or a in-between-releasescode. This works with the micro version which must be even on release.Any odd number means you are basically using random git code.There can be any combination of GIMP_RELEASE and GIMP_UNSTABLE. Forinstance 2.99.12 is a release of the unstable branch, whereas 2.10.33 isdevelopment code of the stable branch.I use this first in the update code as we were using GIMP_UNSTABLE forboth concepts but it made it harder to test. Now:* GIMP_DEV_VERSIONS_JSON environment variable is only available on  development code, not on release (whether stable or unstable).* The weekly check limitation is also only for releases (dev code just  check at every startup to quickly detect issues and regressions).* Whether to look on testing website or public website json file depends  on the code being a release or not.* Finally only whether to check "DEVELOPMENT" or "STABLE" sections in  the json file depends on whether we are on stable or unstable  branches.	2

Furthermore, when the widget iscontained in a GtkPaned, make sure that it has a minimal size forthe duration of the drag operation, so that the drop area isvisible even if the widget is normally hidden.	1

KAFKA-10427:  Fetch snapshot API (#9553)Implements the code necessary for the leader to response to fetch snapshot requests and for the follower to fetch snapshots. This API is described in more detail in KIP-630: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-630%3A+Kafka+Raft+Snapshot.  More specifically, this patch includes the following changes:Leader Changes:1. Raft leader response to FetchSnapshot request by reading the local snapshot and sending the requested bytes in the response. This implementation currently copies the bytes to memory. This will be fixed in a future PR.Follower Changes:1. Raft followers will start fetching snapshot if the leader sends a Fetch response that includes a SnapshotId.2. Raft followers send FetchSnapshot requests if there is a pending download. The same timer is used for both Fetch and FetchSnapshot requests.3. Raft follower handle FetchSnapshot responses by comping the bytes to the pending SnapshotWriter. This implementation doesn't fix the replicated log after the snapshot has been downloaded. This will be implemented in a future PR.Reviewers: Jason Gustafson <jason@confluent.io>	5

HOTFIX / KAFKA-14130: Reduce RackAwarenesssTest to unit Test (#12476)While working on KAFKA-13877, I feel it's an overkill to introduce the whole test class as an integration test, since all we need is to just test the assignor itself which could be a unit test. Running this suite with 9+ instances takes long time and is still vulnerable to all kinds of timing based flakiness. A better choice is to reduce it as a unit test, similar to HighAvailabilityStreamsPartitionAssignorTest that just test the behavior of the assignor itself, rather than creating many instances hence depend on various timing bombs to not explode.Since we mock everything, there's no flakiness anymore. Plus we greatly reduced the test runtime (on my local machine, the old integration takes about 35 secs to run the whole suite, while the new one take 20ms on average).Reviewers: Divij Vaidya <diviv@amazon.com>, Dalibor Plavcic	1

KAFKA-13690: Fix flaky test in EosIntegrationTest (#11887)I found a couple of flakiness with the integration test.IQv1 on stores failed although getting the store itself is covered with timeouts, since the InvalidStoreException is upon the query (store.all()). I changed to the util function with IQv2 whose timeout/retry covers the whole procedure. Example of such failure is: https://ci-builds.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/Kafka%2Fkafka-pr/detail/PR-11802/11/tests/With ALOS we should not check that the output, as well as the state store content is exactly as of processed once, since it is possible that during processing we got spurious task-migrate exceptions and re-processed with duplicates. I actually cannot reproduce this error locally, but from the jenkins errors it seems possible indeed. Example of such failure is: https://ci-builds.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/Kafka%2Fkafka-pr/detail/PR-11433/4/tests/Some minor cleanups.Reviewers: A.

tools: win32_command() return value is never freed.On Windows, the macros COPY, REMOVE and REMOVE_DIR are allocatedstrings, unlike on other platforms, so the way we use these returnedvalues, they are never freed.Instead make win32_command() keep a copy of the allocated string asstatic to the function and free it there at each next call (the returnedvalue being type-casted to (const gchar *)). It will still leak the laststring, but anyway gimptool is short-lived.Also it should silence static analyzers.	1

MINOR: fix flaky ConsumerBounceTest.testCloseFixes `java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.lang.AssertionError: Close finished too quickly 5999`.The close test sets a close duration in milliseconds, but measures the time taken in nanoseconds. This leads to small error due to the resolution in each, where the close is deemed to have taken too little time.When I measured the start and end with nanoTime, I found the time taken to close was `5999641566 ns (5999.6ms)` which seems close enough to be a resolution error. I've run the test 50 times and have not hit the "Close finished too quickly" issue again, whereas previously I hit a failure pretty quickly.Author: Lucas Bradstreet <lucas@confluent.io>Reviewers: Ismael Juma <ismael@juma.me.uk>Closes #7683 from lbradstreet/flaky-consumer-bounce-test	3

Fix Celery executor getting stuck randomly because of reset_signals in multiprocessing (#15989)Fixes #15938multiprocessing.Pool is known to often become stuck. It causes celery_executor to hang randomly. This happens at least on Debian, Ubuntu using Python 3.8.7 and Python 3.8.10. The issue is reproducible by running test_send_tasks_to_celery_hang in this PR several times (with db backend set to something other than sqlite because sqlite disables some parallelization)The issue goes away once switched to concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor. In python 3.6 and earlier, ProcessPoolExecutor has no initializer argument. Fortunately, it's not needed because reset_signal is no longer needed because the signal handler now checks if the current process is the parent.	0

plug-ins: PSD layers with clipping set need clip to backdrop as composite modeCertain PSD layers have a flag called clipping set to 1. We were nothandling this flag and had some reports about colors bleeding wherethey were not supposed to.We are going to set GIMP's layer composite_mode toGIMP_LAYER_COMPOSITE_CLIP_TO_BACKDROP, which is the closest we can getto PhotoShop's clipping. With this, the colors won't bleed anymore.This isn't the whole solution since PS apparently stops compositing whenit encounters a layer without clipping set, while GIMP doesn't stop untilit reaches the bottom layer of a group or the image.This is the first part of a fix for issue #5438.	0

plug-ins: clean out some warnings.This cleans just a third of the warnings in this metadata plug-in. It isa very bad practice to define static const strings in a header file likethis, especially if this header is included in several files. Let's makethese macros.Also why are these header tags sometimes used with the const name (nowmacros), sometimes directly with the string literals? I fixed some ofthese, but more string literals are lying around.Remaining warnings are similar, about const string arrays. If really wewant this, we should declare these extern and define them in a separateimplementation file. This whole plug-in should be really reorganized andcleaned in depth.	4

StreamThread: minor, renaming `shutdown` to `completeShutdown`, and `close` to `shutdown`, `stillRunning` to `isRunning`, `isInitialized` to `isRunningAndNotRebalancing`.3. GlobalStreamThread: tighten the transition a bit in `setState`. Force transiting to `PENDING_SHUTDOWN` and `DEAD` when initialization failed.4. GlobalStreamThread: minor, add logPrefix to StateConsumer. Also removing its state change listener when closing the thread.5. KafkaStreams: because of 1) above we can now prevent its `REBALANCING` to `REBALANCING`.6. KafkaStreams: prevent `CREATED` to ever go to `REBALANCING` first to force it transit to `RUNNING` when starting. Also prevent `CREATED` to go to `ERROR`.7. KafkaStreams: collapse `validateStartOnce` and `checkFirstTimeClosing ` into `setState`.8. KafkaStreams: in `close` and `start`, only execute the logic when `setState` succeeds.Author: Guozhang Wang <wangguoz@gmail.com>Author: Damian Guy <damian.guy@gmail.com>Reviewers: Damian Guy <damian.guy@gmail.com>, Matthias J.

app: do not assume procedures always have a run mode.This is especially true since procedures are defined by plug-ins,possibly third-party.

What if you make a plug-in which always work in a single modeand don't ever plan/want to make it work interactively for instance?Lastly old Python 2 plug-ins didn't even have a run mode parameter (Iguess our old Python 2 wrapper was getting rid of it?).	1

For example file sources oftenrequest block locations for all files (to facilitate locality aware assignments), currently resulting inone RPC call to the Name Node for each file.When the FileStatus obtained from listing the directory (or getting details for a file) already hasthe block locations, we can save the extra RPC call per file to obtain that block location information.This closes #13394	5

Removes pip download when installing from local packages (#13422)This PR improves building production image from local packages,in preparation for moving provider requirements out of setup.cfg.Previously `pip download` step was executed in the CI scriptsin order to download all the packages that were needed. Howeverthis had two problems:1) PIP download was executed outside of Dockerfile in CI scripts   which means that any change to requirements there could not   be executed in 'workflow_run' event - because main branch version   of CI scripts is used there. We want to add extra requirements   when installing airflow so in order to be able to change   it, those requirements should be added in Dockerfile.   This will be done in the follow-up #13409 PR.2) Packages downloaded with PIP download have a "file" version   rather than regular == version when you run pip freeze/check.   This looks weird and while you can figure out the version   from file name, when you `pip install` them, they look   much more normal. The airflow package and provider package   will still get the "file" form but this is ok because we are   building those packages from sources and they are not yet   available in PyPI.Example:  adal==1.2.5  aiohttp==3.7.3  alembic==1.4.3  amqp==2.6.1  apache-airflow @ file:///docker-context-files/apache_airflow-2.1.0.dev0-py3-none-any.whl  apache-airflow-providers-amazon @ file:///docker-context-files/apache_airflow_providers_amazon-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl  apache-airflow-providers-celery @ file:///docker-context-files/apache_airflow_providers_celery-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl  ...With this PR, we do not `pip download` all packages, but insteadwe prepare airflow + providers packages as .whl files andinstall them from there (all the dependencies are installedfrom PyPI)	2

[Relay] Change when int8 operations are converted to int16 on Arm (#12671)Currently, Relay QNN uses its `helper_no_fast_int8_hw_legalization` to convert most `int8` convolution and dense operations into `int16` ones on Arm. This currently occurs on ARM chips except for `v8.2a` chips with `dotprod` support.However, this behavior means that `int8` operations are replaced with `int16` ones on Cortex-M chips. On these chips `int16` is substantially slower, as while it saves a few sign extension operations, it doubles the amount of memory loads we need to perform. This PR changes when `helper_no_fast_int8_hw_legalization` is used on Arm, and instead makes **not** doing this replacement the standard. We will only do this replacement if we are on a chip with ASIMD support but without `v8.2a` and `dotprod`. This ensures that Cortex-M microcontrollers do not have `int8` operations turned into `int16` ones.I have also verified that this does, in fact, improve performance for some common models. For example, MobileNet_v1_0.25 on the Cortex-M4 saw a 10% performance improvement, compared to before this change. Accuracy does not seem to be affected.	4

[AIRFLOW-4237] Including Try Number of Task in Gantt Chart (#5037)	2
app: improve GimpSpinScale cursors.Aryeom noted that current top arrow cursor comes from a time when theinteraction with this widget depended on a lower versus upper region anddoesn't gives anymore any idea of what the click would do.So let's replace the top-arrow cursor with a "grab" cursor, which evenbecomes a "grabbing" cursor when a grab is in progress.Also let's now use gdk_cursor_new_from_name() with standard names fromthe CSS specification, because it is the recommended way. According toGDK docs, GDK cursor list is taken from the X cursor font and apparentlynot all cursors are available on all platforms. So let's use thestandard CSS list, whose cursors are said to be available accrossplatforms (at least very very likely, I guess).Finally I renamed the target enum for the widget to be more semanticthan upper/lower which don't mean anything anymore in our newinteraction rules.	1

Better host handling in CompilationConfig & debug printing (#9460)(This is a bit of a grab bag in preparation for #9326which I'm trying to minimize)While switching the device planner to use SEScopes I had a lotof trouble with Target's not matching up.- If no explicit host target is given but the given  TargetMap has targets with hosts, try to use those  to establish the host_target.- Make sure both the 'legacy' TargetMap representation  and the newer representation agree to pointer equality on  their targets.- Make sure the Interpreter uses the target from CompilationConfig  since it's been normalized.To debug the above:- When in pretty printing with show_meta_data_ false give as much  detail on SEScopes, Targets and call attributes as possible.  That needed some rework in the relay_text_printer.cc.- Ditto for critical 'target' attribute on PrimFuncs.- Also added a Target::ToDebugString so I could see the  host fields along with everything else since a lot of problems  were caused by a mismatch of 'the same' Target with and without  a host. (Tried using that for the ReprPrinter but broken unit  tests.)Note that the codebase assumes Targets are compared by ObjectPtrEquality,yet CheckAndUpdateHostConsistency (I count 65 call sites) changes the targets.Ultimately CompilationConfig or it's ultimate replacement should ensure we mungetargets only once at the 'main' entry points.	1

Bug 724692 - Canvas rotation stuck with specific order of actions.The bug was affecting actually both canvas rotation and panning whendone with space key. If the first mouse button was also clicked, thenreleased after the space key, we ended up in some stuck action. It couldonly be unstuck by hitting/releasing space again.I am actually unsure that this was not originally done on purpose,especially since the code has these 2 status variables space_pressed andspace_release_pending, but really apart from looking at this code, thebehavior just looks very buggy and impracticable.The new behavior is to just stop the canvas panning/rotation as soon asspace is released (which is also how it is documented in our manual, andhow everyone seems to use the feature). I only kept the variablespace_release_pending, which I use as was used space_pressed before.	1

KAFKA-8351; Cleaner should handle transactions spanning multiple segments (#6722)When cleaning transactional data, we need to keep track of which transactions still have data associated with them so that we do not remove the markers. We had logic to do this, but the state was not being carried over when beginning cleaning for a new set of segments. This could cause the cleaner to incorrectly believe a transaction marker was no longer needed. The fix here carries the transactional state between groups of segments to be cleaned.Reviewers: Dhruvil Shah <dhruvil@confluent.io>, Viktor Somogyi <viktorsomogyi@gmail.com>, Jason Gustafson <jason@confluent.io>	5

With this, a stop replica requests with 2000 partitions to be deleted takes ~2 secs instead of ~40 secs previously.Refactor the checkpointing methods to not compute the logsByDir all the time. It is now reused as much as possible.Refactor the exception handling. Some checkpointing methods were handling IOException but the underlying write process already catches them and throws KafkaStorageException instead.Reduce the logging in the log cleaner manager. It does not log anymore when a partition is deleted as it is not a useful information.Reviewers:  Jason Gustafson <jason@confluent.io>, Ismael Juma <ismael@juma.me.uk>, Jun Rao <junrao@gmail.com>	5

MINOR: Move `KafkaYammerMetrics` to server-common (#11970)With major server components like the new quorum controller being moved outside of the `core` module, it is useful to have shared dependencies moved into `server-common`. An example of this is Yammer metrics which server components still rely heavily upon. All server components should have access to the default registry used by the broker so that new metrics can be registered and metric naming conventions should be standardized. This is particularly important in KRaft where we are attempting to recreate identically named metrics in the controller context. This patch takes a step in this direction. It moves `KafkaYammerMetrics` into `server-common` and it implementsstandard metric naming utilities there. Reviewers: Manikumar Reddy <manikumar.reddy@gmail.com>	4

Move breeze commands to sub-commands (#25449)* mOve breeze commands to sub-commandsOriginally Python version of Breeze had only a handful of commands,while moving from Bash, but we are close to completion of thetransition and the number of commands grew quite a lot bringit iton par to the commands we used to have in the Bash version of Breeze.However, only a small subset of the commands is actually useful toaverage developer, most of the more advanced commands are used inspecific circumstances (release management, configuring Breezeonce or rebuilding the image or even runing non-interactive testsession are rarely used. Therefore it makes much more sense tosurface the common commands as the top-level commands and movethe less frequent commands to subcommands to move them out fromthe main help page.At the same time, the BREEZE.rst documentation got a little messyduring the move and this is the right time to structure it similarlyto breeze commands:* prerequisites and installation* first-time configuration* regular task description* more advanced tasks grupped in the same subcommands as in Breeze* diving deeper into details of Breeze implentation for those  who wish to understand how Breeze works under-the-hoodAliases for the common commands that users could already get used towere created, and deprecation warnings are printed in casee thosecommands are used (guiding the user to the new commands to use).Less frequently used options for shell command are still availablein `shell` but they have been removed from the default command toremove clutter. You can still used them by explicitly specifyingthe `shell` commnd.Configuration for rich click has been separated out from thecommand group implementation to separate packages. This allowsfor less problems with circular imports - none of the commandsare needed when rich-click configuration is being prepared, whichhappens before main `click` command is parsed, which allows torun imports of the "code" as late as possible.* Update manage-dags-files.rst	2

StreamTask: added one more function to expose the consumed offsets from repartition topics only.3. TaskManager: use the AdminClient to send the gathered offsets to delete only if a) previous call has completed and client intentionally ignore-and-log any errors, or b) no requests have ever called before.NOTE that this code depends on the assumption that purge is only called right after the commit has succeeded, hence we presume all consumed offsets are committed.4.

app: do not update the tree view editable renderer when editing.When double-clicking the non-selected layer, the functiongimp_view_renderer_set_border_color() was being called, which in turncalled gimp_view_renderer_update() after some idle time.Unfortunately when this happened, the "update" handlergimp_container_tree_store_renderer_update() would callgtk_tree_model_row_changed() which triggers a focus out through GTK.One way to handle this would be to call gimp_view_renderer_update()directly when changing border color (no idle time), though it's actuallymore efficient to just cancel the idle function when we start editingthe item name.

[TIR] Prevent loop binding over-simplification (#11578)@vinx13 @jinhongyii and I observe a recent regression on TVM mainline: over-simplification in`Schedule.split` leads to information loss that negatively impacts search space generation.**Impact.** This affects common operators like `softmax` and even simpler reductions.**Example.** Consider splitting a simple reduction loop:```python@T.prim_funcdef main(    A: T.Buffer[2, "float32"],    B: T.Buffer[2, "float32"],    C: T.Buffer[(), "float32"],) -> None:    for i in T.serial(2):  # <= split `i` into `i_0` and `i_1`, where `i_0` is a trivial loop        with T.block("C"):            k = T.axis.reduce(2, i)            with T.init():                C[()] = T.float32(1)            C[()] = T.min(C[()], A[k] / B[k])```Splitting loop `i`  by factors `[1, 2]`, we get:```python@T.prim_funcdef main(    A: T.Buffer[2, "float32"],    B: T.Buffer[2, "float32"],    C: T.Buffer[(), "float32"],) -> None:    for i_0, i_1 in T.grid(1, 2):        with T.block("C"):            k = T.axis.reduce(2, i_1)  # <= i_0 is not part of the binding,                                       # so the system cannot tell if i_0 is a reduction loop            with T.init():                C[()] = T.float32(1)            C[()] = T.min(C[()], A[k] / B[k])```In this case, loop `i_0` will be considered as a spatial loop, even it’s the outcome of splittinga reduction loop. However, if we change the factors from `[1, 2]` to `[2, 1]`, loop `i_0` becomesa reduction loop. This means the loop iteration property depends on the loop extent.**Why is it problematic**? MetaSchedule has an assumption: extremely seldomly, a loop extent wouldimpact the iteration property of the loop itself, i.e. no matter the extent is 1 or 2 or anything,the fact that the loop is a reduction loop should rarely change.As an example, `Auto-Bind` finds the outer `k` spatial loops, which are fused together and bound tothread axis. In the trace, the number (`k`) of the outer loops has to be a constant.However, if Auto-Bind thinks there are `k=3` outer loops to fuse during search space generation,where the last loop happens to be a reduction loop with extent 1, as shown below:```pythonfor spatial_loop_0 in range(...):  for spatial_loop_1 in range(...):    for reduction_loop in range(1):  # <= Auto-Bind mistakes this loop as spatial, because extent==1```During evolutionary search, the extent of reduction_loop will change and become larger than 1.In this case, the binding strategy will consistently fail because it considers fusing `k=3` loops- which means the entire search strategy will fail with almost no valid candidates.Thanks @MasterJH5574 for figuring out the root cause of the issue,and @jinhongyii for valuable pointers to the right fix!	0

Parallelize build of documentation. (#15062)This is far more complex than it should be because ofautoapi problems with parallel execution. Unfortunately autoapidoes not cope well when several autoapis are run in parallel onthe same code - even if they are run in separate processes andfor different packages. Autoapi uses common _doctree and _apidirectories generated in the source code and they overrideeach other if two or more of them run in parallel.The solution in this PR is mostly applicable for CI environment.In this case we have docker images that have been already builtusing current sources so we can safely run separate dockercontainers without mapping the sources and run generationof documentation separtely and independently in each container.This seems to work really well, speeding up docs generation2x in public GitHub runners and 8x in self-hosted runners.Public runners:* 27m -> 15mSelf-hosted runners:* 27m -> < 8m	1

[Arith] Updated BufferDomainTouched to use IRVisitorWithAnalyzer (#11970)* [Arith] Allow binding of Var in IntSetAnalyzerThe other four subanalyzers in `arith::Analyzer` can each be providedwith variable bindings/constraints that are remembered internally.This adds the same capability to `IntSetAnalyzer`, rather thanrequiring users to independently track and maintain a `Map<Var,IntSet>` containing the domain of each variable, and appliesbindings/constraints alongside the other subanalyzers.* [Arith] Updated IRVisitorWithAnalyzer to mimic IRMutatorWithAnalyzerPreviously, `IRVisitorWithAnalyzer` did not allow subclassing, andcould only be used to collect bounds of variables along an entirestatement, and could not be used to perform scope-dependent analysis.This commit removes `final` from `IRVisitorWithAnalyzer` and providesthe same scope-based constraints/bindings during iteration as areprovided by `IRMutatorWithAnalyzer`.* [Arith] Moved IRVisitorWithAnalyzer to tvm::arith namespaceChanging for consistency, since `IRVisitorWithAnalyzer` it is part ofthe `src/arith` directory and the analogous `IRMutatorWithAnalyzer` isalready part of the `arith` namespace.* [Arith] Updated BufferDomainTouched to use IRVisitorWithAnalyzerThis used the earlier changes to allow subclasses of`IRVisitorWithAnalyzer`, and to expose binding/constraints to`IntSetAnalyzer`.* Avoid accidental Bind with dynamic Range* [Arith] Do not visit SelectNode in IRVisitorWithAnalyzerBecause both sides of a `Select` node are visited regardless of thecondition, the `SelectNode::condition` should not be treated as aknown value.* [Arith][IntSet] Track global and scope-dependent bounds separatelyResolves a bug that was found in CI, where an earlier scope-dependentconstraint was treated as a conflict by a later global bound.* [Arith] Recovery function for each subanalyzerThis way, if a subanalyzer throws an exception during`EnterConstraint`, the other subanalyzers are still appropriatelybacked out of the constraint.* [Arith][IntSet] Use CanProve instead of CanProveGreaterEqualThe `min_value - max_value` in the `CanProveGreaterEqual` argument canresult in an exception being thrown for unsigned integers wheresubtraction would wrap.* [Arith] Allow vector expressions in IntSet::operator(PrimExpr)Since these are tracked when lowering expressions, should allowpost-vectorization expressions.To maintain previous behavior, this only applies when using theautomatically tracked `Map<Var, IntSet> dom_map_`.  If an explicitdomain map is passed, the previous behavior of raising an error forvectorized expressions still occurs.* Avoid comparisons between integer and handle datatypes* [Arith] IntSet, Combine() extensionPreviously, the Combine() method didn't handle values without a knownlower bound, for boolean operators.* Added docstring* Naming consistency of `IntSetAnalyzer` methods.To be consistent with other subanalyzers, using "Update" whenproviding the analyzer with the same data structure as is usedinternally, and "Bind" used when providing it with something that mustbe converted to the internal data structure.	5

[FLINK-6160] Add reconnection attempts in case of heartbeat timeouts to JobMaster and TaskExecutorIf a timeout with the RM occurs on on the JobMaster and TaskExecutor, then they will both try to reconnectto the last known RM address.Additionally, we now respect the TaskManagerOption#REGISTRATION_TIMEOUT on the TaskExecutor. This means thatif the TaskExecutor could not register at a RM within the given registration timeout, it will fail with afatal exception. This allows to fail the TaskExecutor process in case that it cannot establish a connectionand ultimately frees the occupied resources.The commit also changes the default value for TaskManagerOption#REGISTRATION_TIMEOUT from "Inf" to "5 min".This closes #6035.	5

app: fix abbreviated commit hashesThe abbreviated commit hash we show in the shell and the aboutdialog is currently just the last 7 characters of 'git describe',based on the assumption that abbreviated hashes are always 7-digitslong.  When the hash is longer than that, we're just showing anonsense commit.This was never a good idea, since users can override this, andsince disambiguation can result in longer hashes, but since git2.11, the default abbreviated hash length is determined based onthe size of the repository, which currently results in 10 digitsfor us.Let's just do it right.	1

KAFKA-13469: Block for in-flight record delivery before end-of-life source task offset commit (#11524)Although committing source task offsets without blocking on the delivery of all in-flight records is beneficial most of the time, it can lead to duplicate record delivery if there are in-flight records at the time of the task's end-of-life offset commit.A best-effort attempt is made here to wait for any such in-flight records to be delivered before proceeding with the end-of-life offset commit for source tasks.

We should compute metadataVersionChanged before _publisher.foreach(publish)    After _publisher.foreach(publish) the BrokerMetadataListener_delta is always Empty, so metadataVersionChanged is always false, this means we will never trigger snapshot generating even metadata version has changed.3. We should try to generate a snapshot when starting publishing    When we started publishing, there may be a metadata version change, so we should try to generate a snapshot before first publishing.Reviewers: Jason Gustafson <jason@confluent.io>, Divij Vaidya <diviv@amazon.com>, José Armando García Sancio <jsancio@users.noreply.github.com>	1

[FLINK-3972] subclasses of ResourceID may not to be serializableWorkerTypes are currently subclasses of ResourceID. ResourceIDimplements Serializable but not necessarily its subclasses. This maylead to problems when these subclasses are used as ResourceIDs,i.e. serialization may fail with NotSerializableExceptions. Currently,subclasses are never send over the wire but they might be in the future.Instead of relying on subclasses of ResourceID for the WorkerTypes, welet them implement an interface to retrieve the ResourceID of aWorkerType.This closes #2037	1

Add docker-context-files detection and cleanup flag. (#15593)When building images for production we are using docker-context-fileswhere we build packages to install. However if those context filesare not cleaned up, they unnecessary increase size and time neededto build image and they invalidate the COPY . layer of the image.This PR checks if docker-context-files folder contains just readmewhen Breeze build-image command is run (for cases whereimages are not built from docker-context-files). Inversely italso checks that there are some files in case the image isbuilt with --install-from-docker-context-files switch.This PR also ads a --cleanup-docker-context-files switch toclean-up the folder automatically.

app: new gimp_spin_scale_set_constrain_drag() and use it on paint...... tools' brush options.After discussions, it turned out that many people disliked that the spinscale for brush size (and some other options) get you fractional values.How often do you actually need to get a 4.32 pixel-size brush? And evenhow meaningful is it? On the other hand, you usually want a 4 or a 5pixel size brush and it's nearly impossible to get (exactly) by draggingthe scale widget.It is so annoying that some even resort to edit the value with keyboard!So I am adding an optional "constrain" feature to GimpSpinScale. It willstill be possible to get fractional values when constraining is on, forinstance with keyboard edit (the arrow incrementation also will keep anyfractional part). So the interaction for such scales is simply reversedso that you get integers easily, and fractional parts with a bit moreeffort.It is not turned on by default (some feature actually need precision andwe don't want to break the sliders for these) and for the time being, Ionly applied it to all the brush settings in paint tools. Now that itexist, we may want to apply this to more scales in various parts ofGIMP.	1

app: fix airbrush periodic stamp behaviorCommit ddfc7715cbcd8d165520902bc0abfff3c09b88f4 changed theairbrush periodic stamp behavior, so that instead of using the mainbrush, it issued a full MOTION event, potentially using a differentbrush when using a GIH brush.Fix this, by renaming the "timeout" signal of GimpAirbrush to"stamp", and by adding a new gimp_airbrush_stamp() function, whichshould be used for painting the periodic airbrush dab in response,instead of calling gimp_paint_core_paint() directly, and whichcalls gimp_airbrush_paint() instead, as the old code did.In order to call this function from the paint thread, we replacethe various gimp_paint_tool_paint_core_foo() functions, introducedin the above commit, with a generic gimp_paint_tool_paint_push()function, which takes a callback (and a data pointer) to run on thepaint thread, and queues it for execution (when not using the paintthread, the function is called directly from the calling thread.)	1

Add better diagnostics capabilities for pre-commits run via CI image (#23980)The pre-commits that require CI image run docker command underthe hood that is highly optimized for performance (only mountsfiles that are necessary to be mounted) - in order to improveperformance on Mac OS and make sure that artifacts are not leftin the source code of Airflow.However that makes the command slightly more difficult to debugbecause they generate dynamically the docker command used,including the volumens that should be mounted when the dockercommand is run.This PR adds better diagnostics to the pre-commit scriptsallowing VERBOSE="true" and DRY_RUN="true" variables that canhelp with diagnosing problems such as running the scripts onWSL2.It also fixes a few documentation bugs that have been missedafter changing names of the image-related static checks andthanks to separating the common code to utility functionit allows to set SKIP_IMAGE_PRE_COMMITS variable to truewhich will skip running all pre-commit checks that requirebreeze image to be available locally.	1

Fixes broken asset compilation in Docker images (#14995)The change #14911 had a bug - when PYTHON_MINOR_MAJOR_VERSIONwas removed from the imge args, the replacement `python -m site`expression missed `/airflow/` suffix. Unfortunately it was notflagged as an error because the recompiling script silentlyskipped recompilation step in such case.This change:* fixes the error* removes the silent-skipping if check (the recompilation will  fail in case it is wrongly set)* adds check at image verification whether dist/manifest.json is  present.Fixes: #14991	0

KAFKA-9849: Fix issue with worker.unsync.backoff.ms creating zombie workers when incremental cooperative rebalancing is used (#8827)When Incremental Cooperative Rebalancing is enabled and a worker fails to read to the end of the config topic, it needs to voluntarily revoke its locally running tasks on time, before these tasks get assigned to another worker, creating a situation where redundant tasks are running in the Connect cluster. Additionally, instead of using the delay `worker.unsync.backoff.ms` that was defined for the eager rebalancing protocol and has a long default value (which coincidentally is equal to the default value of the rebalance delay of the incremental cooperative protocol), the worker should quickly attempt to re-read the config topic and backoff for a fraction of the rebalance delay. After this fix, the worker will retry for a maximum time of 5 times before it revokes its running assignment and for a cumulative delay less than the configured `scheduled.rebalance.max.delay.ms`.Unit tests are added to cover the backoff logic with incremental cooperative rebalancing.

[FLINK-14818][benchmark] Fix InputGate setup logic of StreamNetworkBenchmarkEnvironmentBefore this change, in network benchmark (for example 1000 channels benchmark with 4 record writers) StreamNetworkBenchmarkEnvironment#createInputGate was creating 1000 input gates with 4 input channels each, which doesn't make much sense. This commit is changing that to a single receiver with 4 input gates and each with 1000 channels.It is achieved by providing testing implementations of InputChannels, which are using channel index for requesting subpartitions from ResultPartition, instead of subpartition index. Thanks to that, we can map a single ResultPartition with N subpartitions, to a single instance of InputGate with N channels.The change also influences the benchmark results, overall, the performance goes down a bit because of the decrease of floating buffers and the followings are benchmark results before and after this change:------------------------------------------------------------------Before----------------------------------------------------------------------Benchmark                                                                     (channelsFlushTimeout)   Mode  Cnt      Score      Error   UnitsDataSkewStreamNetworkThroughputBenchmarkExecutor.networkSkewedThroughput                         N/A  thrpt   30  17079.534 ±  830.532  ops/msStreamNetworkBroadcastThroughputBenchmarkExecutor.networkBroadcastThroughput                     N/A  thrpt   30    599.664 ±   13.325  ops/msStreamNetworkThroughputBenchmarkExecutor.networkThroughput                                 100,100ms  thrpt   30  45629.898 ± 1623.455  ops/msStreamNetworkThroughputBenchmarkExecutor.networkThroughput                             100,100ms,SSL  thrpt   30   9817.421 ±  216.075  ops/msStreamNetworkThroughputBenchmarkExecutor.networkThroughput                                  1000,1ms  thrpt   30  25442.152 ±  968.340  ops/msStreamNetworkThroughputBenchmarkExecutor.networkThroughput                                1000,100ms  thrpt   30  27944.285 ±  518.106  ops/msStreamNetworkThroughputBenchmarkExecutor.networkThroughput                            1000,100ms,SSL  thrpt   30   7820.549 ±  895.862  ops/msStreamNetworkLatencyBenchmarkExecutor.networkLatency1to1                                         N/A   avgt   30     13.184 ±    0.093   ms/op------------------------------------------------------------------After-----------------------------------------------------------------------Benchmark                                                                     (channelsFlushTimeout)   Mode  Cnt      Score      Error   UnitsDataSkewStreamNetworkThroughputBenchmarkExecutor.networkSkewedThroughput                         N/A  thrpt   30  17345.574 ±  370.647  ops/msStreamNetworkBroadcastThroughputBenchmarkExecutor.networkBroadcastThroughput                     N/A  thrpt   30    608.881 ±   12.054  ops/msStreamNetworkThroughputBenchmarkExecutor.networkThroughput                                 100,100ms  thrpt   30  41732.518 ± 1109.436  ops/msStreamNetworkThroughputBenchmarkExecutor.networkThroughput                             100,100ms,SSL  thrpt   30   9689.525 ±  202.895  ops/msStreamNetworkThroughputBenchmarkExecutor.networkThroughput                                  1000,1ms  thrpt   30  24106.705 ± 2952.364  ops/msStreamNetworkThroughputBenchmarkExecutor.networkThroughput                                1000,100ms  thrpt   30  27509.665 ± 3246.965  ops/msStreamNetworkThroughputBenchmarkExecutor.networkThroughput                            1000,100ms,SSL  thrpt   30   7691.287 ±  927.775  ops/msStreamNetworkLatencyBenchmarkExecutor.networkLatency1to1                                         N/A   avgt   30     12.758 ±    0.147   ms/op	1

[AIRFLOW-6565] BigQuery - replace deprecated connection parameters (#7173)	2
[streaming] iteration source/sink refactor	4
app/core: Use NULL for "simple" signalsApart from being less code, this actually gives us a nice performanceimprovement. Up until a few years ago, if you pass `NULL` as themarshaller for a signal, GLib would fall back to`g_cclosure_marshal_generic` which uses libffi to pack/unpack itsarguments. One could avoid this by specifying a more specificmarshaller which would then be used to immediately pack and unpack intoGValues with the correct type.Lately however, as a way of optimizing signal emission (which can bequite expensive), GLib added a possibility to set a va_marshaller, whichskips the unnecessary GValue packing and unpacking and just uses avalist variant.Since the performance difference is big enough, if the marshallerargument is NULL, `g_signal_new()` will now check for the simplemarshallers (return type NONE and a single argument) and set both thegeneric and the valist marshaller. In other words, less code for us withbigger optimizations.In case you also want va_marshallers for more complex signals, you canuse `g_signal_set_va_marshaller()`.	1

app: compress tool motion evnets more conservativelyWhen compressing tool motion events, only compress motion eventsat the front of the event queue, targeted at the same widget as,and having similar characteristics to, the initial motion event;stop compressing upon the first mismatched event.Previously, all pending motion events targeted at the canvas werecompressed, stopping only at a button-release event targeted at thecanvas.  As a result, when adding a guide by dragging from a ruler,there could be a situation where a pending button-release eventtargeted at the ruler would be followed by motion events targeted atthe canvas, with a cleared state mask.  These motion events wouldget compressed to the initial motion event targeted at the ruler,resulting in a motion event with a cleared state mask being processedbefore the said button-release event.  This, in turn, would cause theguide tool's cursor_update function to be called, while the tool isstill active, emitting a CRITICAL.  Sheesh.The moral of the story is: let's play it safe.	1

[FLINK-18934][runtime] Idle stream does not advance watermark in connected streamWatermark in the two and multi input operators is computed in operators.

KAFKA-7987: Reinitialize ZookeeperClient after auth failures (#7751)Schedules client reinitialization if Zookeeper auth failure is encountered.

MINOR: Log client disconnect events at INFO level (#11449)Client disconnects are crucial events for debugging. The fact that we only log them at DEBUG/TRACE means we rarely have them available outside of a testing context. This patch therefore increases verbosity to INFO level.

[FLINK-16408] Let TaskExecutor reuse LibraryCacheManager instancesThis commit changes how LibraryCacheManager are being used. Instead of creating a new instance for every new job the TaskExecutor executes, the TaskExecutor will only have a single LibraryCacheManager which is used for all jobs to execute. This will decrease the number of class instances a TaskExecutor has to create a bit.This change also changes the lifecycle of the LibraryCacheManager a little bit: The LibraryCacheManager will now be closed as part of the TaskManagerServices which happens when the TaskExecutor shuts down.	4

Fix zombie task handling with multiple schedulers (#24906)Each scheduler was looking at all running tasks for zombies, leading tomultiple schedulers handling the zombies. This causes problems withretries (e.g. being marked as FAILED instead of UP_FOR_RETRY) andcallbacks (e.g. `on_failure_callback` being called multiple times).When the second scheduler tries to determine if the task is able to be retried,and it's already in UP_FOR_RETRY (the first scheduler already finished),it sees the "next" try_number (as it's no longer running),which then leads it to be FAILED instead.The easy fix is to simply restrict each scheduler to its own TIs, asorphaned running TIs will be adopted anyways.	1

[RFC] [Contrib] Minimal runtime (~12kb .text on ARMv7/x86) for subset of TVM models (#3567)This is an alternative implementation of a subset of the TVM runtime API (andgraph runtime) that focuses entirely on reducing code size, at the expense offunctionality (no tvm.extern(..) calls via PackedFunc, CPU only, etc). It mightbe worth incrementally expanding the surface area if there's interest.The motivation for this work was seeing what the minimal useful subset of theTVM runtime is. This is relevant for e.g. super code-size constrainedapplications in e.g. embedded/mobile. The current runtime is more like O(100KiB)or so, so this might be compelling for some users.The smaller surface area for auditing might make this relevant forhttps://github.com/dmlc/tvm/issues/3159, or the usecases I was thinking about inhttps://github.com/dmlc/tvm/issues/2523#issuecomment-459165815 re: the Rustruntime.The symbols in the tvm::minimalruntime space (i.e. excluding std:: andpicojson::) are about 5KiB, so I think there's a bunch of room here (i.e. wecould replace picojson:: with [`jsmn`](https://zserge.com/jsmn.html) orsomething, and we could replace more of the `std::unordered_map` usage, etc withcustom primitives as well (similar to the `DynArray`).	5

Finish support for list-of-targets (#11382)* Finish support for list-of-targetsThis finishes the work started in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/11173 to support'external codegen' targets in the N build-like API surfaces. - It turns out it's ok if a build is given only a single 'external codegen' target, so remove that check   in CompilationConfig::Init. When Collage builds a 'candidate partition' it does so for a single target.   As far as Collage is concerned it does not care whether the target is regular (eg Target("cuda")), or   for a specific external codegen (eg Target("cutlass")), it just passes the target into the build. - Add CompilationConfig::FindPrimitiveTargetForKind which I'll later need to retrieve   the external codegen Target instance corresponding to a "Compiler" attribute value. - Target.update_target_host_consist was supporting three API styles:    - single target    - map from device type to target    - map from target to IRModule (for the ir_to_runtime API)   I replaced all those calls with a more specialized 'canonicalize' call:    - Target.canonicalize_target_and_host    - Target.canonicalize_multi_targets_and_host    - Target.canonicalize_target_map_and_host   In particular, all the tuning interfaces (task extraction, tuning, tuning records) all explicitly   *do not* support multiple targets since the underlying code just doesn't support that.* - Lints- Revert unintended changes* - more lints* - Fix model_library_format handling of target.- Improve comments in compilation_config.h* - Lints- Update target/target_host params documentation* - Fix micro library format tests- Rev micro library format from 5 to 6- Use Target.current() in a few places* - eta contract comprehension* - Woops, one more device: target map left- Handle host already being in Target* - lint* - lint* - Bug with append- Take device type from target* - Fix hexagon	0

[FLINK-5890] [gelly] GatherSumApply broken when object reuse enabledThe initial fix for this ticket is not working on larger data sets.Reduce supports returning the left input, right input, a new object, ora locally reused object. The trouble with the initial fix was that thereturned local object was reusing fields from the input tuples.The problem is with ReduceDriver#run managing two values (reuse1 andreuse2) and with a third, local value returned byGatherSumApplyIteration.SumUDF. After the first grouping value.f1 ==reuse1.f1. Following UDF calls may swap value.f1 and reuse2.f1, whichcauses reuse1.f1 == reuse2.f1. With an odd number of swaps the nextgrouping will reduce with reuse1 and reuse2 sharing a field anddeserialization will overwrite stored values.The simple fix is to only use and return the provided inputs.This closes #3515	1

MINOR: fix failing ZooKeeper system tests (#10297)ZooKeeper-related system tests in zookeeper_security_upgrade_test.py andzookeeper_tls_test.py broke due to #10199. That patch changed the logic ofSecurityConfig.enabled_sasl_mechanisms() to only add the inter-broker SASLmechanism when the inter-broker protocol was SASL_{PLAINTEXT,SSL}. Theinter-broker protocol is left to default to PLAINTEXT for the SecurityConfiginstance associated with Zookeeper since that value doesn't apply to ZooKeeper,so the default inter-broker SASL mechanism of GSSAPI was not being added intothe set returned by enabled_sasl_mechanisms(). This is actually correct --GSSAPI shouldn't be added since inter-broker communication is a Kafka conceptand doesn't apply to ZooKeeper. GSSAPI should be added when ZooKeeper uses it,though -- which is the case in these tests. So the prior patch referred toabove uncovered a bug: we were relying on the default inter-broker SASLmechanism to signal that Kerberos was being used by ZooKeeper even though theinter-broker protocol has nothing to do with that determination in such cases.This patch explicitly includes GSSAPI in the list of enabled SASL mechanismswhen SASL is enabled for use by ZooKeeper.Reviewers: Colin P.

Made all brushes scalable from the tool options. So far only downscaling2006-11-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>Made all brushes scalable from the tool options. So far onlydownscaling is supported since we lack an algorithm for bitmapbrush upscaling. Addresses bug #65030.* app/paint/gimppaintoptions.[ch]: added "brush-scale" property.* app/paint/gimpbrushcore.[ch]: separate pressure logic from brushscaling logic and take paint_options->brush_scale into account.Added gimp_brush_core_create_bound_segs() which returns BoundSegsof the correctly scaled brush mask for the brush preview on thecanvas.* app/tools/gimpbrushtool.c: use gimp_brush_core_create_bound_segs()instead of doing this here (also removes all knowledge about lowlevelstuff from this file).

Issue #287: Impossible to stroke a path with the clone tool.Actually we had half of the fix already with my recent change to sourcetools giving the ability to clone from multiple source drawables where Imoved the source drawables from GimpSourceCore to GimpSourceOptions (seecommit 6ad00cdbba7). The problem is that gimp_vectors_stroke() is usingthe context paint options, but it is creating a brand new paint corejust to stroke the path. Hence with my recent changes, the drawablesources were finally available to the path stroke, yet not the sourceposition. So stroking with clone was always starting on position (0, 0)on the source.This is now fixed by moving also the position properties "src-x" and"src-y" on the GimpSourceOptions. This makes this info finallyaccessible to the core when running the source tools this way.Thanks to Eneko Castresana Vara for their initial contribution.Unfortunately the code had diverged too much for it to be usable becauseof our much too late review so a different fix had to be done.	0

Use ci.py explicitly in docs building instructions (#9971)This adds `ci.py` to the docs to make it more clear how to easily build the docs locally.

This still preserves it though in the docs step as a way to quickly bail out if there are formatting errors so the full tutorials don't get built.Co-authored-by: driazati <driazati@users.noreply.github.com>	1

Documentation on task mapping additions (#24489)* Documentation on task mapping additionsNone of these actually exist yet. These are the additions planned for2.5 on AIP-42 (task mapping), namely expand_kwargs(), map(), filter(using Airflow's existing mechanism), and zip().The examples for expand_kwargs() and zip() are pretty bad now.Suggestions are much welcomed.Let's discuss the interface in this patch's thread; once we settle onthe syntax and semantic, I'll start implementing them.* Detect common user error passing a task to map()The argument to map() must be a plain function, not a task. This hookchecks for that.	1

app, libgimp: reverse internal l10n logic of plug-in labels in core app.I hesitated a lot whether we should just drop the whole localization ofplug-ins' label and description (blurb) within the core. Actually thecommit messages I wrote a few days ago were moving towards this logic.It really looks to me like plug-in localization can happen fully withinplug-in themselves. As far as I can see, the only advantage which thecurrent logic has theoretically is that if we needed, we have access toboth the original strings and their translations (e.g. it could beuseful for text search). Nevertheless I am not sure if we will ever makeuse of this, and this is limited cases as all filters turned GEGL opsdon't have such ability anyway.Nevertheless since previous contributors clearly put quite a lot of workon this code of localizing the plug-in's label and description withinthe main binary, I want to give myself a little more time to think andstudy the whole thing because doing anything rash.In the meantime, what changes is that by default now, a plug-in withouta local gettext catalog is simply not localized. In particular, the coreprocess doesn't try to localize it using the default catalog, a.k.a.GETTEXT_PACKAGE"-std-plug-ins" ("gimp30-std-plug-ins"). It just doesn'tmake sense and the worst which could happen would be to get unexpectedand wrong translations.Now by default, plug-ins will try to find a catalog in their mainfolder, named as this folder. If it fails to find it, a message isprinted to stderr and localization is disabled (rather than falling backto a default catalog). It is up to plug-in developers to either installa catalog, or implement set_i18n() to give the right catalog, folder, ordisable localization with gettext, as handled by libgimp.	0

Implements generation of separate constraints for core and providers (#14227)There are two types of constraints now:* default constraints that contain all depenedncies of airflow,  all the provider packages released at the time of the relese  of that version, as well as all transitive dependencies. Following  those constraints, you can be sure Airflow's installation is  repeatable* no-providers constraints - containing only the dependencies needed  for core airflow installation. This allows to install/upgrade  airflow without also forcing the provider's to be installed at  specific version of Airflow.This allows for flexible management of Airflow and Providerpackages separately. Documentation about it has been added.Also the provider 'extras' for apache airflow do not keep directdependencies to the packages needed by the provider. Thosedependencies are now transitive only - so 'provider' extras onlydepend on 'apache-airflow-provider-EXTRA' package and allthe dependencies are transitive. This will help in the futureto avoid conflicts when installing newer providers using extras.	1

Issue #1682 - Segfault when starting GIMP, due to empty data filesUse gimp_input_data_stream_read_line_always(), instead ofg_input_data_stream_read_line(), in a bunch of places that don'texpect EOF.  If we don't do that, the code assumes the GErrorparameter is set by the function and returns an error indication,causing the caller to segfault when it tries to accesserror->message.  Instead, we now process an empty line when EOF isreached, which is caught by the normal parsing logic.Additionally:  - Use gimp_ascii_strto[id]() when loading gradients, generated    brushes, and palettes, to improve error checking for invalid    numeric input.  - Improve gradient-segment endpoint consistency check.  - Allow loading palette files with 0 colors.  They can be created    during the session, so we might as well successfully load them.	1

KAFKA-4901; Make ProduceRequest thread-safeIf request logging is enabled, `ProduceRequest` can be accessedand mutated concurrently from a network thread (which calls`toString`) and a request handler thread (which calls`clearPartitionRecords()`).That can lead to a `ConcurrentModificationException` when iteratingthe `partitionRecords` map.The underlying thread-safety issue has existed since the serverstarted using the Java implementation of ProduceRequest in 0.10.0.However, we were incorrectly not clearing the underlying struct until0.10.2, so `toString` itself was thread-safe until that change. In 0.10.2,`toString` is no longer thread-safe and we could potentially see a`NullPointerException` given the right set of interleavings between`toString` and `clearPartitionRecords` although we haven't seen thathappen yet.In trunk, we changed the requests to have a `toStruct` methodinstead of creating a struct in the constructor and `toString` wasno longer printing the contents of the `Struct`. This accidentallyfixed the race condition, but it meant that request logging was lessuseful.A couple of days ago, `AbstractRequest.toString` was changed toprint the contents of the request by calling `toStruct().toString()`and reintroduced the race condition. The impact is more visiblebecause we iterate over a `HashMap`, which proactivelychecks for concurrent modification (unlike arrays).We will need a separate PR for 0.10.2.Author: Ismael Juma <ismael@juma.me.uk>Reviewers: Jiangjie Qin <becket.qin@gmail.com>, Onur Karaman <okaraman@linkedin.com>, Jun Rao <junrao@gmail.com>Closes #2689 from ijuma/produce-request-thread-safety	2

KAFKA-9335: Fix StreamPartitionAssignor regression in repartition topics counts (#7904)This PR fixes the regression introduced in 2.4 from 2 refactoring PRs:#7249#7419The bug was introduced by having a logical path leading numPartitionsCandidate to be 0, which is assigned to numPartitions and later being checked by setNumPartitions. In the subsequent check we will throw illegal argument if the numPartitions is 0.This bug is both impacting new 2.4 application and upgrades to 2.4 in certain types of topology. The example in original JIRA was imported as a new integration test to guard against such regression. We also verify that without the bug fix application will still fail by running this integration test.Reviewers: Guozhang Wang <wangguoz@gmail.com>	3

[Relay] Merge analysis/context_analysis.cc and transforms/device_annotation.cc (#9038)* [Relay] Merge analysis/context_analysis.cc and transforms/device_annotation.ccCurrently LowerTEPass (backend/te_compiler.cc) is a 'special' pass because itdepends on a side-input DeviceMap. We'd like to remove that side-input, andinstead recover the Device (and, ultimately, Target) for each (fused) primitivecall from the AST alone.By doing so we also avoid needing to perform device planning twice: - It needs to be done before lowering so we know which primitives need   to be compiled for which devices. - It then needs to be re-done after lowering and optimization as a prelude   to memory planning.By baking the device plan into the AST we can simply do device planning beforelowering, and run memory planning later, both as ordinary passes.While working on that issue we realized we currently have 3 'device planners': - transforms/device_annotation.cc, which supports only a small subset of Relay   and uses a simple top-down algorithm to assign a device to every   sub-expression. - analysis/context_analysis.cc, which makes a galant effort to support most of   Relay, is based on unification rather than a top-down algorithm, but handles   higher order functions by ad-hoc and fragile inlining. - transforms/annotate_target.cc, which works on Targets instead of Devices, but   is otherwise like 'device planning'.We'd like to bring these together.In this PR we introduce a new transforms/device_planner.cc intended to replacetransforms/device_annotation.cc and analysis/context_analysis.cc. We don'tdelete those two just yet since we need to switch all users off of them in thenext PR. We also leave transforms/annotate_target.cc alone pending a proper RFCto bring devices and targets together sensibly, but have it firmly in oursights.transforms/device_planner.cc is based on analysis/context_analysis.cc, butis heavily reworked to: 1. Handle starting from existing "on_device" annotations as well as existing    "device_copy" calls. 2. Be idempotent, with the idea we'll probably need to re-run it to 'refine'    device planning to account for storge scopes. 3. Robustly handle all of Relay, particularly higher-order functions. For that    we replace the inlining approach in analysis/context_analysis.cc with a    higher-order unification domain. 4. Be a little more systematic with defaulting. 5. Capture the result of the analysis within the AST as new "device_copy" calls    at device boundaries, and new/replaced "on_device" calls wherever the device    for a sub-expression is not already 'obvious' from the sub-expression's    lexical scope. 6. Provide helper visitors for passes which need to ask for the device for    any sub-expression they are processing and/or preserve device information    on rewrites. Those passes include:     - backend/aot_executor_codegen.cc (AOTOnDemandAllocator)     - backend/graph_plan_memory.cc (StorageAllocaBaseVisitor etc)     - backend/te_compiler.cc (LowerTensorExprMutator)     - backend/vm/lambda_lift.cc (LambdaLifter)     - transforms/memory_alloc.cc (DialectRewriter)     - transforms/to_a_normal_form.cc (Fill)     - backend/vm/compiler.cc (VMFunctionCompiler)    However we won't change any of those in this PR.See the draft https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8788 for the end game.* [checkpoint] Use Relay script for all unit tests.* [checkpoint] Hoist out DeviceDomain and DeviceDomains.* [checkpoint] Hoist out visitors* [checkpoint] Woops, left debug-only code in	0

KAFKA-10602: Make RetryWithToleranceOperator thread safe (#9422)ErrantRecordReporter uses a RetryWithToleranceOperator instance, which is necessarily stateful, having a ProcessingContext of which there's supposed to be one per task. That ProcessingContext is used by both RetryWithToleranceOperator.executeFailed() and execute(), so it's not enough to just synchronize executeFailed().So make all public methods of RetryWithToleranceOperator synchronized so that RetryWithToleranceOperator is now threadsafe.Tested with the addition of a multithreaded test case that fails consistently if the methods are not properly synchronized.

plug-ins: move py-slice.py to gimp-data-extras.Per polls on Twitter, Reddit, Patreon and Tipeee, most people werewilling to drop this plug-in as not being relevant anymore (247 fordropping and 63 for keeping it, so nearly 80% out of 310 participants).So let's move it to gimp-data-extras allowing it to still have apossible life, and who knows, maybe to even evolve.See also corresponding commit beffc6b to gimp-data-extras repository.	5

Issue #3265: PNG gAMA chunk is silently ignored.PNG has support for profiles, which is the state-of-the-art way tohandle color management nowadays. But it also had some very basic colormanagement based on a gAMA chunk (for the gamma) and a cHRM chunk(primary chromaticities).We don't have a core concept with just these and don't want to walkbackward anyway, but we can easily make basic RGB profiles from these.This is what this commit is about. It generates profiles at import whichwere not actually inside the image, but only represented by these 2 PNGchunks. What gives it away is that GIMP will propose to convert/keep theprofile at start (unless configured otherwise, as any profile), and theprofile name will specify it is a profile generated from PNG chunks'values.  One can even discard the profile later (if you didn't convert),so it gives a solution if somehow these metadata were not proper.	5
[AIRFLOW-6454] And script to benchmark scheduler dag-run time (#7537)This script will run the SchedulerJob for the specified dags "to completion".That is it creates a fixed number of DAG runs for the specified DAGs (fromthe configured dag path/example dags etc), disable the scheduler fromcreating more, and then monitor them for completion. When the file task ofthe final dag run is completed the scheduler will be terminated.The aim of this script is to have a benchmark for real-world schedulerperformance -- i.e. total time take to run N dag runs to completion.It is recommended to repeat the test at least 3 times so that you can getsomewhat-accurate variance on the reported timing numbers.	1

app: add some doc comment to internal API.Relative to the MR !553 where I could verify that the functiongimp_tool_push_status() does not just push new messages, it also removesany other message from the same context (and place the new one onfront, unlike gimp_tool_replace_status()).Therefore calling gimp_tool_pop_status() before a push or replace issimply wrong with undesirable effect (e.g. too many useless redraws,which can be pretty bad on some platforms like macOS, but are not idealanyway as a general rule).	1

[TIR] Handle axis_separators during FlattenBuffer (#12652)* [TIR] Moved tir.FlattenBuffer to occur before tir.LowerOpaqueBlockFor buffers with more than one physical axis, the `axis_separators`are required in order to know which groups of logical axes to fuseinto each physical axis.  The implementation in `tir.FlattenBuffer`assumed that all buffers were being flattened to a single physicalaxis.  Because `tir.LowerOpaqueBlock` replaces the`BlockNode::alloc_buffers` with `Allocate` nodes, `tir.FlattenBuffer`no longer has access to the axis separators and performs inconsistentflattening for `Allocate` as opposed to `BufferLoad`/`BufferStore`.This was introduced in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/12172, whichdecoupled the lowering/flattening steps.The commit reorders the `tir.FlattenBuffer` to occur before`tir.LowerOpaqueBlock`, to make use of the axis separators.  Any`Allocate` nodes that exist at that point (e.g. from hand-writtenschedules) are still flattened to 1-d physical buffers, but the`BlockNode::alloc_buffers` are flattened according to the axisseparators.* Add unit test to validate non-flat memory after tvm.lower* Explicitly write T.reads for test on BufferRegion updates* Update incorrect docstring for test* Use DeclBuffer information in FlattenBufferThe DeclBuffer node can be inserted during LowerOpaqueBlock, thenprovide the missing Buffer information required to flatten theallocation.* Use T.allocate in unit testsWith the insertion of `DeclBuffer` nodes, `LowerOpaqueBlock` no longerneeds to be before `FlattenBuffer`, and has been moved back to itsoriginal position.  Revering the tests to use `T.allocate` instead of`T.alloc_buffer` more closely represents the functions as they arebeing lowered.* Fix usage of T.decl_buffer in updated tests* Update LowerOpaqueBuffer to expect the DeclBuffer nodes* Strip DeclBuffer annotation in FlattenBufferThe DeclBuffer annotations aren't yet supported in all passes.  Thisrestricts them to being introduced in LowerOpaqueBuffer, thenimmediately removed in FlattenBuffer.* Strip out all DeclBuffer nodes in FlattenBuffer* Update unit tests to remove expectation of DeclBuffer nodes	4

tools: add a `flatpak-releases` tool for quick testing with Flatpak.Sometimes we want to make quick tests on old versions of GIMP.Rebuilding from source is definitely still an option, yet with flatpak,we have many past builds available easily to us (at time of writing: 19stable builds, 12 dev point-release builds and at least 3 nightlies —though I seem to have issues with signatures on gnome-nightly right now,so maybe there are more!).There are some command lines needed to check the build history, then toinstall a specific build, which I explained in developer docs (seedevel-docs/debugging-tips.txt, section "Testing older GIMP versions").Yet it's clearly cumbersome and slow so I wrote this script today toautomatize the process a bit.Running simply this command will list all available releases on theFlathub repository (adding --beta or --nightly will list the developmentreleases and nightly builds instead):$ tools/flatpak-releasesThe listing will contain a topic describing the build as well as thedate, all this prefixed by a number.

(e04355dd) [2021-04-26 14:08:32 +0000] …The last build updates dependencies, the previous one fixes somespecific issue and the 2 previous ones are point releases.Now say I needed to test/compare some behavior with how it was in 2.99.6(e.g. to verify a regression), I would then run:$ tools/flatpak-releases --beta -3This would install this specific dev build number 3. In just 2easy-to-remember commands and a few seconds, we can therefore list andinstall specific Flatpak builds.	1

KAFKA-4183; Centralize checking for optional and default values in JsonConverterCleaner to just check once for optional & default value from the `convertToConnect()` function.It also helps address an issue with conversions for logical type schemas that have default values and null as the included value. That test case is _probably_ not an issue in practice, since when using the `JsonConverter` to serialize a missing field with a default value, it will serialize the default value for the field. But in the face of JSON data streaming in from a topic being [generous on input, strict on output](http://tedwise.com/2009/05/27/generous-on-input-strict-on-output) seems best.Author: Shikhar Bhushan <shikhar@confluent.io>Reviewers: Randall Hauch <rhauch@gmail.com>, Jason Gustafson <jason@confluent.io>Closes #1872 from shikhar/kafka-4183	5

Revert "Bug 790784 - (CVE-2017-17784) heap overread in gbr parser / load_image."This reverts commit 06d24a79af94837d615d0024916bb95a01bf3c59.The CVE is still fixed but now in a different way. Commit 4fa0cd4dcfpasses instead the accurate string length when using the string, hencemaking it work even when not NUL-terminated. This has the advantage ofhaving the GBR file loaded in the end, despite such file format error. Iam personally not persuaded this is the best path since a file with suchan error may either be corrupted, or worse may have been constructed onpurpose to be harmful, so rejecting it directly may be the safe choice.Nevertheless I may also be too doubtful and maybe trying to save aslightly corrupted file may be the nicest choice indeed.	2

KAFKA-13011; Update deleteTopics Admin API  (#10892)This patch adds two new apis to support topic deletion using topic IDs or names.

Finally, it modifies `DeleteTopicsResult` to support both names and IDs and deprecates the old methods which have become ambiguous.

[AIRFLOW-365] Set dag.fileloc explicitly and use for Code viewCode view for subdag has not been working.

I think it isappropriate to instead setit to the actual child dag location instead. We donot lose anyinformation this way (we still have the link tothe parent dag thathas its location) and now we can always read thisattribute for thecode view. This should not affect the use of thisfield for refreshingdags, because we always refresh the parent for asubdag.Closes #2043 from dhuang/AIRFLOW-365	2

Some icons were missinghere, other there.With this new organization, the Preferences icons are listed in a singlefile, ensuring usage and contents consistency. Also it allows to installthem only for the needed sizes (note that it is possible that they mightbe needed in different size, for instance with custom themes; but wecan't just randomly distribute icons in all sizes; or to be moreaccurate, this is exactly why we encourage rather the SVG/scalableicons, so if some people explicitly go for raster icons, they also getthe drawbacks which come with).Last note: it may be possible that some icons end up in different"semantic" icon group. This is not a problem with this new organizationas my scripts handle duplicates gracefully.	0

[FFI][CYTHON] Release GIL when calling into long running functions (#11461)Unlike ctypes, Cython by default do not release GIL whencalling into C API functions.

It fixes the timeout issue inPopenPool which previously relied on another python threadfor timeout.Added a regression test-case by changing sleep to sleepin FFI, which previously will indefinitely block the popen tests.	3

I guess multi-layer TIFF is morefor multi-page (at least with G3/G4 which is apparently a fax format, soit makes sense) than actual multi-layer.So I use the new GIMP_EXPORT_NEEDS_OPAQUE_LAYERS capability fromprevious commit for this particular use case of export layers + G3/G4compression.Also it is better to run gimp_export_image() *after* the option dialog,as we do for other formats, with variable capabilities depending onwhich options was chosen, instead of running it before then aftermerging layers when user chose not to export layers. This is duplicatingthe purpose of gimp_export_image().	1

A keyed backend can checkpoint the state that itkeeps by using a CheckpointStreamFactory.This also refactors how asynchronous keyed state snapshots work. Theyare not implemented using a Future/RunnableFuture.Also, this changes the keyed state backends to be key-group aware and tosnapshot the state in key-groups with an index for restoring.	4

KAFKA-3896: Fix KStreamRepartitionJoinTestThe root cause of this issue is that in InternalTopicManager we are creating topics one-at-a-time, and for this test, there are 31 topics to be created, as a result it is possible that the consumer could time out during the assignment in rebalance, and the next leader has to do the same again because of "makeReady" calls are one-at-a-time.This patch batches the topics into a single create request and also use the StreamsKafkaClient directly to fetch metadata for validating the created topics. Also optimized a bunch of inefficient code in InternalTopicManager and StreamsKafkaClient.Minor cleanup: make the exception message more informative in integration tests.Author: Guozhang Wang <wangguoz@gmail.com>Reviewers: Damian Guy, Matthias J.

Uses always the same Python base image as used for CI image (#12177)When new Python version is released (bugfixes), we rebuild the CI imageand replace it with the new one, however releasing of the pythonimage and CI image is often hours or even days apart (we onlyrelease the CI image when tests pass in master with the new pythonimage). We already use a better approach for Github - we simplypush the new python image to our registry together with the CIimage and the CI jobs are always pulling them from our registryknowing that the two - python and CI image are in sync.This PR introduces the same approach. We not only push CI imagebut also the corresponding Python image to our registry. This hasno ill effect - DockerHub handles it automatically and reusesthe layers of the image directly from the Python one so it ismerely a label that is stored in our registry that points to theexact Python image that was used by the last pushed CI image.	1

[hotfix] Integrate TaskExecutor.jobManagerConnections into JobManagerTableThis commit merges the data structure TaskExecutor.jobManagerConnections into the JobManagerTable. The reason why this is possible is that jobManagerConnections is only a different index which maps ResourceID to JobManagerConnection. By letting the DefaultJobManagerTable use a DualKeyLinkedMap<JobID, ResourceID, JobManagerConnection> it is possible to remove the other index which simplifies the TaskExecutor.	4
app: add gimp_item_{start,end}_move()Add gimp_item_{start,end}_move(), and correspondingGimpItem::{start,end}_move() virtual functions, which should becalled before/after "moving" the item (i.e., translating, scaling,resizing, flipping, rotating, or transforming the item).  Movesperformed between the outermost pair of start/end calls are treatedatomically.What exactly does "treated atomically" entail depends on thesubclasses -- GimpItem doesn't provide a default implementation forthese functions, so the current commit doesn't change any behavior.The next commit, which adds layer-mask support for group layers,uses the functions to avoid cropping the mask too early while achild is moving.GimpItem calls {start,end}_move() in the various "move" functions(gimp_item_{translate,scale,...}(), before performing the actualoperation.  Additionally we call the functions in thegimp_image_item_list_foo() functions, for each participating item,so that the items are moved as a unit.  We call the functions inthe various gimp_image_remove_foo() functions, since removing anitem may affect the size of its ancestors, and is therefore akin tomoving.  We also call the functions in GimpEditSelectionTool, sothat the move tool moves items atomically while dragging.	4

libgimp: fix and workaround Exif.Photo.UserComment interpretation.Here are the changes:- Separate the check for comment contents and the one of whether or not  it starts with "charset=Ascii ". Indeed in my tests, we still want to  handle the empty string case or the "binary comment" case even without  the charset prefix (currently it was both or none, so I encountered  cases with a broken "binary comment" comment because the charset  prefix was absent).- Add some #warning in order not to forget to remove the bogus "binary  comment" test. Indeed after some digging in Exiv2 code, I could  confirm this return value got removed in commit 9b510858 of Exiv2  repository, i.e. since Exiv2 0.27.4. Now in my test case where I had a  tag containing only 0s, Exiv2 returns an empty string, which is  perfectly fine (and it's up to us to keep or ignore it).- Use gexiv2_metadata_try_get_tag_interpreted_string() instead of their  deprecate non-try counterparses. Right now, I am just outputting any  error message to stderr, as I'm not sure if this is the kind of errors  we want to warn people about. I guess it would depend on which type of  errors exactly are returned, so let's see if we encounter some case in  the future. For now stderr is fine to detect these.	0

MINOR: increase system test kafka start timeout (#5934)The Kafka Streams system tests fail with some regularity due to a timeout starting the broker.The initial start is quite quick, but many of our tests involve stopping and restarting nodes with data already loaded, and also while processing is ongoing.Under these conditions, it seems to be normal for the broker to take about 25 seconds to start, which makes the 30 second timeout pretty close for comfort.I have seen many test failures in which the broker successfully started within a couple of seconds after the tests timed out and already initiated the failure/shut-down sequence.Reviewers: Guozhang Wang <wangguoz@gmail.com>	0

[FLINK-19927][coordination] Enable ExecutionStateUpdateListener state updates in EG independent from legacy schedulingThe state updates for ExecutionStateUpdateListener in ExecutionGraph#notifyExecutionChange are not done at the momentbecause ExecutionGraph#notifyExecutionChange is currently enabled only for legacy scheduling.This prevents from stopping deployment tracking for execution state TM/JM reconciliation, hence it leads to memory leaks.The state update handling is supposed to be done only in SchedulerNG (DefaultScheduler), not in legacy code of ExecutionGraph.However, this generally requires more refactoring for execution deployment tracking and reconciliation.Hence, this commit just enables ExecutionStateUpdateListener state updates in ExecutionGraph#notifyExecutionChange for SchedulerNG as a quick fix,before we refactor the execution deployment tracking and reconciliation.JobMasterExecutionDeploymentReconciliationTest#testExecutionDeploymentReconciliation is also extended with the checkthat ExecutionStateUpdateListener is called and the execution deployment tracking is stopped.The commit also refactors tests in JobMasterExecutionDeploymentReconciliationTest and introduces TestingExecutionDeploymentTrackerWrapper to facilitate ExecutionDeploymentTracker call checks.This closes #13908.	3

Doc: Add Callbacks Section to Logging & Monitoring (#18842)Airflow users often ask for an easy way to monitor the success or failure of tasks and/or DAGs. The use of callbacks, such as on_success_callback, helps users monitor DAG runs in an easily configurable way.This document provides an overview of available callbacks, linked to the relevant section in the Tasks document. It also provides a simple example of calling a function on any task failure in the DAG, as well as a separate function that is called upon the success of the last task in the DAG.	2

KAFKA-9216: Enforce internal config topic settings for Connect workers during startup (#8270)Currently, Kafka Connect creates its config backing topic with a fire and forget approach.This is fine unless someone has manually created that topic already with the wrong partition count.In such a case Kafka Connect may run for some time. Especially if it's in standalone mode and once switched to distributed mode it will almost certainly fail.This commits adds a check when the KafkaConfigBackingStore is starting.This check will throw a ConfigException if there is more than one partition in the backing store.This exception is then caught upstream and logged by either:- DistributedHerder#run- ConnectStandalone#mainA unit tests was added in KafkaConfigBackingStoreTest to verify the behaviour.Author: Evelyn Bayes <evelyn@confluent.io>Co-authored-by: Randall Hauch <rhauch@gmail.com>Reviewer: Konstantine Karantasis <konstantine@confluent.io>	5

KAFKA-7461: Add tests for logical typesAdded testing of logical types for Kafka Connect in support of KIP-145 features.Added tests for Boolean, Time, Date and Timestamp, including the valid conversions.The area of ISO8601 strings is a bit of a mess because the tokenizer is not compatible withthat format, and a subsequent JIRA will be needed to fix that.A few small fixes as well as creating test cases, but they're clearly just corrections such asusing 0 to mean January (java.util.Calendar uses zero-based month numbers).Author: Andrew Schofield <andrew_schofield@uk.ibm.com>Reviewers: Mickael Maison <mimaison@users.noreply.github.com>, Ewen Cheslack-Postava <ewen@confluent.io>Closes #6077 from AndrewJSchofield/KAFKA-7461-ConverterValuesLogicalTypesTest	3

KAFKA-13957: Fix flaky shouldQuerySpecificActivePartitionStores test (#12289)Currently the tests fail because there is a missing predicate in the retrievableException which causes the test to fail, i.e. the current predicatescontainsString("Cannot get state store source-table because the stream thread is PARTITIONS_ASSIGNED, not RUNNING"),containsString("The state store, source-table, may have migrated to another instance"),containsString("Cannot get state store source-table because the stream thread is STARTING, not RUNNING")wasn't complete. Another one needed to be added, namely "The specified partition 1 for store source-table does not exist.". This is because its possible forassertThat(getStore(kafkaStreams2, storeQueryParam2).get(key), is(nullValue()));orassertThat(getStore(kafkaStreams1, storeQueryParam2).get(key), is(nullValue()));(depending on which branch) to be thrown, i.e. seeorg.apache.kafka.streams.errors.InvalidStateStorePartitionException: The specified partition 1 for store source-table does not exist.at org.apache.kafka.streams.state.internals.WrappingStoreProvider.stores(WrappingStoreProvider.java:63)at org.apache.kafka.streams.state.internals.CompositeReadOnlyKeyValueStore.get(CompositeReadOnlyKeyValueStore.java:53)at org.apache.kafka.streams.integration.StoreQueryIntegrationTest.lambda$shouldQuerySpecificActivePartitionStores$5(StoreQueryIntegrationTest.java:223)at org.apache.kafka.streams.integration.StoreQueryIntegrationTest.retryUntil(StoreQueryIntegrationTest.java:579)at org.apache.kafka.streams.integration.StoreQueryIntegrationTest.shouldQuerySpecificActivePartitionStores(StoreQueryIntegrationTest.java:186)This happens when the stream hasn't been initialized yet.

For me, it's theonly way I use this when making/editing PDFs with GIMP, but maybe somepeople would still want GIMP to crawl into groups and subgroups andexport layers individually. That's why I make it an option, defaultingat TRUE.	1

[FLINK-11036] Fix test_streaming_classloader.sh end-to-end testBefore, this was relying on .version.properties being available in theflink-dist jar. This was not the case when building from a Flink sourcerelease.This is fixed by introducing a fake lib package that we place in thelib/ folder to test the classloader resolution order. Both the libpackage and the user package contain a parent-child-test.properties andwe check the resolution order in the test.Also change the test to not use TaskManager anymore.This test was relying on TaskManager being present in Flink, this mightnot be the case in the future. We change this test to place a fake classin the "lib" package and the "user" package to make it independent ofthe rest of Flink.	2

[TIR] Moved PrimExpr operator overload from op.h to expr.h (#11973)* [TIR] Moved PrimExpr operator overload from op.h to expr.hIf a compilation unit includes `<tvm/ir/expr.h>`, but does not include`<tvm/tir/op.h>`, the operator overloads for `ObjectRef` are declared,but the operator overloads for `PrimExpr` are not.  In this case, anyuse of `expr_a == expr_b` would use `ObjectRef`'s implementation andcompare reference equality of the two expressions, rather thanreturning a `PrimExpr` that represents the comparison.  By having theoperator overloads in the `<tvm/ir/expr.h>` header file, directlyadjacent to the `PrimExpr` declaration, the correct overload must beavailable whenever the `PrimExpr` can be used.Even though this would only impact `operator==`, `operator!=`, and`operator<`, the three operators defined for `ObjectRef`, this PRmoves all operator overloads to `expr.h` for consistency.The named version of the operators (e.g. `tvm::add`) do not haveoverloaded variants, and so they are intentionally kept in`<tvm/tir/op.h>`.* Explicitly convert TVMRetValue to bool in target.ccNeeded to avoid ambiguity between `TVMRetValue -> bool` conversion and`TVMRetValue -> int -> PrimExpr` conversion.* Used vector/unordered_set to track BufferInfoExtractor::call_order_Use of `std::set<Call>` had ambiguity between `operator<` by`PrimExpr` or by `ObjectRef`.The comment for `call_order_` implied that the previous usage of`std::set<Call>` was intended to have a de-duplicated list in theorder of occurrence.  However, the `std::set` was ordered by`ObjectRef::operator<`, not by insertion order.  Switching to using a`vector` for ordering and `unordered_set` for de-duplication resolvesthis issue, and also removes the use of `operator<`.* Remove C-style cast to fix lint error	0

app: create and use gimp_image_item_list_linked().This function returns a new list of items from an input list. The outputlist will optionally contains linked items if any of the input item islinked so we don't have to rewrite the same duplicated code for everyfeature where item links matter.Moreover it also filters descendants if any of the input items is anitem group, hence avoiding to apply a transformation twice to adescendant item.Use this new function already in 2 places, hence skimming quite a bit ofredundant code.	1

plug-ins: clean up a bit file-pdf-save.This improves commit bbd5ebbe8a. Several parameters did not need to goinside draw_layer().

This also allowsproper shortcut to end the loop earlier on the first error.Also the layer index parameter does not need to be a pointer since itnever requires updates.Finally declare variables in smaller scopes for cleaner code.	4

app: allow filter actions to have hardcoded default operation settingsby encoding them directly in the string attached to all filteractions. The code now supports both "gegl:some-operation" and"gegl:some-operation\n<serialized config>".Add "default_settings" to GimpGeglProcedure to store the settings ofthe invoking action, much like the "default_run_mode" member.Change filters-commands.c to parse the new operation string, createGimpGeglProcedures with the deserialized settings, and use thosesettings when the procedures are ran.Change the filter history to be smarter about what is already in thehistory, there can now be several different procedures with the samename.Remove the dilate and erode actions from the drawable group, and addthem to filters, they are just special cases of value-propagate withfixed settings.	1
Bug 749902 - Add Hue-Chroma operation/tool and LCH color selectorThis patch increases the LCH Chroma slider maximum value from 100 to200 and also makes the Chroma slider properly display out of gamutChroma selections for any given Hue/Lightness combinations.The current Chroma slider only runs to 100. But quite a few sRGBcolors have LCH chroma values that are greater than 100. For examplereddest red has a chroma of 107, and bluest blue has a chroma of 131.So it's inconvenient to have to deal with a Chroma slider limit of100.Also, the current Chroma slider doesn't properly show out of gamutareas on the Chroma slider. So for example picking a given LCH Hue andthen moving the Lightness slider doesn't allow to see which Lightnessvalue allows for choosing the maximum in-gamut chroma for the chosenHue.	1

app: make demo scripting even simpler/cleaner.First I strip now every pieces of text. What it allows it to span thescript elements for instance on several lines, indent them and all that.The second thing is that since all the dockable start with "gimp-", wemay as well allow use shorter names (both are allowed). Same for tool(which we special-case), all the tool buttons ID start with "tools-"since we reused the action names. So let's just allow the shorterversions.Finally I create a new gimp_blink_toolbox() which is a specializedgimp_blink_dockable() for the toolbox in particular. I also move therethe whole code about selecting the right tool.	4

Move setgid as the first command executed in forked task runner (#20040)The runner setgid command was executed after importing several airflowimports, which - when executed for the first time could take quitesome time (possibly even few seconds). The setgid command should bedone as soon as possible, in case of any errors in the import, itwould fail and the setgid could be never set.Also this caused the test_start_and_terminate test to fail in CIbecause the imports could take arbitrary long time (depending onparallel tests and whether the imported modules were alreadyloaded in the process so setting the gid could be set after morethan 0.5 seconds.This change fixes it twofold:* setgid is moved to be first instruction to be executed (also  signal handling was moved to before the potentially long  imports)* the test was fixed to wait actively and only fail after the  timeout of 1s (which should not happen before of the fix above)Additionally the test was using `task test` command rather than task run,and in some circumstances when you tried to run it locally,when FORK was disabled (MacOS) the same test could fail witha different error because --error-file flag is not defined for`task test` command but it is automatically added by the runner.The task command has been changed to `run'Fixing this tests caused occasional test_on_kill failurewhich suffered from similar problem and had similar sleepimplemented.Thanks to that the test will be usually faster as no significant delayswill be introduced.	3

[Hexagon] Asynchronous DMA support (#12411)Adds adds asynchronous DMA support through the Hexagon User DMA engine with unit tests to validate basic functionality. Asynchronous DMA support here means the ability to "kick off" asynchronously a number of DMAs using the Copy API and then to Poll for or Wait on a number of "in flight" (not done) DMAs. Enables future testing and development for asynchronous memory copy on Hexagon. For now, Hexagon DMA support remains synchronous in nature through existing hexagon_user_dma_1d_sync interface which uses asynchronous capable HexagonUserDMA class in a synchronous way --- calling Copy and Wait back to back for each request.* use ring buffer to store DMA descriptors* add RingBuffer class; used by HexUserDMA to store descriptors* add test to overflow the HexagonUserDMA ring buffer	1

KAFKA-4561; Ordering of operations in StreamThread.shutdownTasksAndState may void at-least-once guaranteesIn `shutdownTasksAndState` and `suspendTasksAndState` we commit offsets BEFORE we flush any state. This is wrong as if an exception occurs during a flush, we may violate the at-least-once guarantees, that is we would have committed some offsets but NOT sent the processed data on to other Sinks.Also during suspend and shutdown, we should try and complete all tasks even when exceptions occur. We should just keep track of the exception and rethrow it at the end if necessary. This helps with ensuring that StateStores etc are closed.Author: Damian Guy <damian.guy@gmail.com>Reviewers: Guozhang Wang <wangguoz@gmail.com>Closes #2281 from dguy/kafka-4561	3

Bug 793777 - CRITICALs on focus change in MWM with stylus.Focus change events were expecting the current tool control to beinactive, which was the case most of the time. Yet with stylus, thecanvas was sometimes receiving GDK_BUTTON_PRESS events beforeGDK_FOCUS_CHANGE. In particular the canvas was receiving a button pressbefore the focus out, then button release and focus in. Therefore by thetime the focus out event happens, the tool control is active, whichbroke a few calls.Therefore I add a few checks and returns immediately whengimp_tool_control_is_active() return TRUE, especially since we also rungimp_display_shell_update_focus() calls after a button press anyway sothe state should already be consistent.	5
Moved the calls to floating_sel_relax()/rigor() from various places to two2004-04-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>Moved the calls to floating_sel_relax()/rigor() from variousplaces to two single spots in the core where they are actuallyneeded.

This commiteffectively removes floating selection fiddling from the core'spublic API.* app/core/gimpdrawable.[ch] (gimp_drawable_has_floating_sel): newfunction which returns TRUE if there is a floating selectionattached to the drawable.* app/core/gimpdrawable.c (gimp_drawable_translate)(gimp_drawable_set_tiles_full): if the drawable *has* a floatingselection, relax/rigor it before/after modifying the drawable.* app/core/gimplayer.c (gimp_layer_translate)(gimp_layer_set_tiles): if the layer *is* the floating selection,relax/rigor it before/after modifying it.* app/core/gimpdrawable-transform.c* app/core/gimpimage-convert.c* app/core/gimpimage-crop.c* app/core/gimpimage-flip.c* app/core/gimpimage-resize.c* app/core/gimpimage-rotate.c* app/core/gimpimage-scale.c* app/gui/layers-commands.c* app/tools/gimpeditselectiontool.c* tools/pdbgen/pdb/layer.pdb: removed calls tofloating_sel_rigor()/relax() all over the place.

libgimp, libgimpconfig: gimp_config_deserialize_file() should not…… assert the existence of GError.This is even worse as deserialize() method does not even take a GErrorparameter anyway so this assert will always go off when adeserialization failed (which happened in my case as I was working on aplug-in API, hence gimp_procedure_config_load_last() actually failed toload a previous version of the plug-in-settings when I changed aprocedure arg's type).Just fail the deserialization normally and let the calling code handlingthis case. Nevertheless it is kind of useful to bubble-up the error tocalling code, so I add a TODO in the interface header (hopefully to seeand improve this before we release GIMP 3.0).	1

By adding `python3: CPU` with just those Integration tests, it lines up with `python3: GPU` and `python3: i386` which both take a similar amount of time and takes roughly 60 minutes off the overall run time.Numbers copied from sample successful run (final time approx: 358 minutes):|Phase|ID                           |Job   |Minutes                                      |Start||-----|-----------------------------|------|---------------------------------------------|-----||0    |0                            |Sanity|3                                            |0    ||1    |0                            |BUILD: arm|2                                            |3    ||1    |1                            |BUILD: i386|33                                           |3    ||1    |2                            |BUILD: CPU|100                                          |3    ||1    |3                            |BUILD: GPU|25                                           |3    ||1    |4                            |BUILD: QEMU|6                                            |3    ||1    |5                            |BUILD: WASM|2                                            |3    ||2    |0                            |java: GPU|1                                            |103  ||2    |1                            |python3: GPU|66                                           |103  ||2    |2                            |python3: arm|22                                           |103  ||2    |3                            |python3: i386|70                                           |103  ||3    |0                            |docs: GPU|3                                            |173  ||3    |1                            |frontend: CPU|40                                           |173  ||3    |2                            |frontend: GPU|185                                          |173  ||3    |3                            |topi: GPU|110                                          |173  ||     |                             |      |                                             |     |Numbers predicted after change (final time approx: 293 minutes):|Phase|ID                           |Job   |Minutes                                      |Start||-----|-----------------------------|------|---------------------------------------------|-----||0    |0                            |Sanity|3                                            |0    ||1    |0                            |BUILD: arm|2                                            |3    ||1    |1                            |BUILD: i386|33                                           |3    ||1    |2                            |BUILD: CPU|35                                           |3    ||1    |3                            |BUILD: GPU|25                                           |3    ||1    |4                            |BUILD: QEMU|6                                            |3    ||1    |5                            |BUILD: WASM|2                                            |3    ||2    |0                            |java: GPU|1                                            |38   ||2    |1                            |python3: GPU|66                                           |38   ||2    |2                            |python3: arm|22                                           |38   ||2    |3                            |python3: i386|70                                           |38   ||2    |4                            |python3: CPU|60                                           |38   ||3    |0                            |docs: GPU|3                                            |108  ||3    |1                            |frontend: CPU|40                                           |108  ||3    |2                            |frontend: GPU|185                                          |108  ||3    |3                            |topi: GPU|110                                          |108  |* Fix typo in ci_cpu commands	2

Remove all deprecation warnings in providers (#17900)There were a number of deprecation warnings when just importingcertain providers or their examples. Some of them came from stillusing 1.10 classes, some from using still `apply_defaults` andsome from badly implemented fallback mechanism to supportbackwards compatibility.This has all been fixed and our documentation generation stepfor providers in CI will also fail in case there are some newDeprecationWarnings generated, which means that they will haveto be fixed before merging.While checking that we found that BigQuery table_resource newapproach had some inconsistencies when passing new `table_resource`parameters. Some deprecated parameters should be None by default,otherwise you'd have to explicitly set them to None when`table_resource` is set but when it is not set, the backwardscompatible behaviour is maintained - the parameters get the same.default values set.Several deprecation warnings had wrong stack-level - this has beenfixed as well.The "legitimate" warnings are now filtered out and they are onlyfiltered out for the appropriate modules we know they are generatedfrom or in case the warnings result from direct import of thedeprecated module.	2

KAFKA-13202: KIP-768: Extend SASL/OAUTHBEARER with Support for OIDC (#11284)This task is to provide a concrete implementation of the interfaces defined in KIP-255 to allow Kafka to connect to an OAuth/OIDC identity provider for authentication and token retrieval. While KIP-255 provides an unsecured JWT example for development, this will fill in the gap and provide a production-grade implementation.The OAuth/OIDC work will allow out-of-the-box configuration by any Apache Kafka users to connect to an external identity provider service (e.g. Okta, Auth0, Azure, etc.). The code will implement the standard OAuth client credentials grant type.The proposed change is largely composed of a pair of AuthenticateCallbackHandler implementations: one to login on the client and one to validate on the broker.See the following for more detail:KIP-768KAFKA-13202Reviewers: Yi Ding <dingyi.zj@gmail.com>, Ismael Juma <ismael@juma.me.uk>, Jun Rao <junrao@gmail.com>	5

[TIR][REFACTOR] Remove te::Tensor dependencies from TIR passes. (#5372)* [TIR][REFACTOR] Remove te::Tensor dependencies from TIR passes.te::Tensor is an useful object for tensor expression, but bringsun-necessary reverse dependency in TIR nodes such as Provide and Realize.This PR is a first step to remove this dependency. We will use Buffer in all the placeswhere the te::Tensor was used. The rough correspondence are:- Provide -> BufferStore- Realize -> BufferRealize- HalideCall -> BufferLoad.After this change, we can not use IRModule of PrimFuncs cleanly to represent TIRat any point of the optimizations. Buffer will serve as the abstraction for the TIR datamodels to represent the intermediate storages and their constraints.We still keep Realize/HalideCall and Provide as TIR nodes for now to make the change minimum.Right after ScheduleOps, we call SchedulePostProcToPrimFunc to canonicalize the temporary IRgenerated by TE(which contains these nodes) to the TIR.The TIR optimizations are now mostly migrated to to the pass manager.Followup PRs are needed to migrate the remaining few passes.* Fix dev tutorial	0

[FLINK-21030][runtime] Adds trigger for global failoverWe cannot assume that the termination future is finishing when triggering asynchronous savepoint. It might be that the savepoint creation succeeds butthe graceful shutdown of the job fails. In this case, the job termination doesnot complete. The job might end up in an inconsistent state. That's why, aglobal fail over is triggered if the scheduler observes one of the currentexecutions ending up in a non-finished state.Unit tests and integration tests are added to cover this use-case.This closes #14847.	1

KAFKA-13807: Fix incrementalAlterConfig and refactor some things (#12033)Ensure that we can set log.flush.interval.ms at the broker or cluster level viaIncrementalAlterConfigs. This was broken by KAFKA-13749, which added log.flush.interval.ms as thesecond synonym rather than the first. Add a regression test to DynamicConfigChangeTest.Create ControllerRequestContext and pass it to every controller API. This gives us a uniform way topass through information like the deadline (if there is one) and the Kafka principal which ismaking the request (in the future we will want to log this information).In ControllerApis, enforce a timeout for broker heartbeat requests which is equal to the heartbeatrequest interval, to avoid heartbeats piling up on the controller queue. This should have been donepreviously, but we overlooked it.Add a builder for ClusterControlManager and ReplicationControlManager to avoid the need to dealwith a lot of churn (especially in test code) whenever a new constructor parameter gets added forone of these.In ControllerConfigurationValidator, create a separate function for when we just want to validatethat a ConfigResource is a valid target for DescribeConfigs. Previously we had been re-using thevalidation code for IncrementalAlterConfigs, but this was messy.Split out the replica placement code into a separate package and reorganize it a bit.Reviewers: David Arthur <mumrah@gmail.com	5

Use new Breese for building, pulling and verifying the images. (#23104)We have the new Python-based breeze and we want to replace allthe functionality used from the old Breeze with the new one.The most important is image management. It is used in manyplaces and this PR replaces all the places and removes imagebuilidng, pushing, pulling to use the new Breeze everywhere.That includes:* Building and pushing CI image on CI* Building and pushing PROD image on CI which includes:  * building Airflow packages  * building Provider packages  * waiting for images in parallel (both CI and and PROD)  * veifying the images (both CI and PROD)All those commands have been moved to breeze.py and that requiredsome modification in the Breeze parameter handling - mainly relatedto adding spaces when help was displayed because long list ofpackages looked very bad in help output.It's been easier to implement it in one big PR as usingimage building and pulling was deeply embedded in many scripts.With this change all the scripts in CI use directly breezeand combine using command line parameters with evn variablesdirectly in the job that execute the breeze commands whichmakes it much easier to understand what is going on andrepeat it locally using Breeze.Fixes: #22825Fixes: #23077Fixes: #23076Fixes: #22829Fixes: #22828Fixes: #22826Fixes: #20961Fixes: #23102Fixes: #21098	0

[TVMScript] Parser `int64` support (#10789)## ContextWhen dealing with end-to-end models, we note that some tensors may have large shapes. Thus, when designing graph-level IR, we sometimes use `int64` instead of `int32` for the shape. Below is an dense GeMM example which has `int64` input tensor shape:```python@tvm.script.ir_moduleclass Module:    @T.prim_func    def main(rxplaceholder: T.Buffer[(1, 512), "float32"], rxplaceholder_1: T.Buffer[(T.int64(1000), T.int64(512)), "float32"], T_matmul_NT: T.Buffer[(1, T.int64(1000)), "float32"]) -> None:        # function attr dict        T.func_attr({"global_symbol": "dense", "tir.noalias": True, "op_pattern": 3})        # body        # with T.block("root")        for i0_0, i1_0, i0_1, i1_1, i2_0, i0_2, i1_2, i2_1, i0_3, i1_3 in T.grid(1, 4, 1, 25, 8, 1, 10, 64, 1, 1):            with T.block("T_matmul_NT"):                i = T.axis.spatial(1, 0)                j = T.axis.spatial(T.int64(1000), i1_0 * T.int64(250) + i1_1 * T.int64(10) + i1_2)                k = T.axis.reduce(512, i2_0 * 64 + i2_1)                T.reads(T_matmul_NT[i, j], rxplaceholder[i, k], rxplaceholder_1[j, k])                T.writes(T_matmul_NT[i, j])                T.block_attr({"layout_free_placeholders":[rxplaceholder_1], "meta_schedule.tiling_structure":"SSRSRS"})                with T.init():                    T_matmul_NT[i, j] = T.float32(0)                T_matmul_NT[i, j] = T_matmul_NT[i, j] + rxplaceholder[i, k] * rxplaceholder_1[j, k]```## ProblemThough our TVMScript printer can easily print `int64` constants, the parser had poor support for `int64`. So this PR introduces some parser support for `int64`, basically about the data type of loop variables, block iterators and block read/write regions.Besides the parser, most of the TIR schedule primitives didn't take `int64` into account in their implementations. These schedule primitives will be fixed and updated in recent future, in followup PRs.	5

Fix migration issues and tighten the CI upgrade/downgrade test (#25869)There was a typo that was not detected in the migration file which prevented upgrades.On fixing the typo, some other migration issues were detected.Apart from postgres, other dbs couldn't upgrade -> downgrade -> upgrade. This was partlybecause we now create new DB from the ORM which also uses a naming convention to create constraints.I have applied a fix, the side effect is that it breaks offline generation of sql for mysql. This is because it uses the new naming convention to create constraints when we run upgrade through the migration file. Inmigration file 0093, we dropped unique keys with names dag_id & dag_id_2 while with the namingconvention in place, these two now have a unique name across all db that's different from the nameswe use to drop the keys. Because of that, I have chosen to use sqlalchemy inspector to get the nameand drop them.	4

libgimpwidgets: improve a bit the position of progress and normal text.The logics to get the progress position is not proper because the textarea (as returned by gtk_entry_get_text_area()) is actually slightlysmaller than the progress area. Unfortunately it doesn't look like thereis an API to get the exact progress area. This commit improves a bit thesituation by starting the progress rectangle when excluding theintersection of 2 rectangles in pango at the start of the text area (notat 0).It's still not perfect as the progress width will be anyway a bit toosmall and we don't have the data to compute it properly, but it's betterthan it used to be. I also set several variables to double instead ofint to be more accurate, though this part doesn't help much.Finally I used the ink extents rather than the logical extents. Since weare here to draw, this is the ink extents which is really needed.Note: for the bug to be visible, you need to have a different text colorfor the progress and non-progress part of the scale.Also I'm unsure about the right-to-left logics which seems very broken.	2

Instead it is now directly insertedinto the text tool box, as selected text. It permits redimensionning ofthe text box while typing, and push the rest of the text when insertingin the middle (instead of superimposing an overlay box over the currenttext box, making everything unreadable).Input methods still have a few more issues, but this fixes the main UIweirdness as well as the crash with Hangul IM.	0

Initial space invasion commit in GIMPAll babl formats now have a space equivalent to a color profile,determining the format's primaries and TRCs. This commit makes GIMPaware of this.libgimp:- enum GimpPrecision: rename GAMMA values to NON_LINEAR and keep GAMMA  as deprecated aliases, add PERCEPTUAL values so we now have LINEAR,  NON_LINEAR and PERCPTUAL for each encoding, matching the babl  encoding variants RGB, R'G'B' and R~G~B~.- gimp_color_transform_can_gegl_copy() now returns TRUE if both  profiles can return a babl space, increasing the amount of fast babl  color conversions significantly.- TODO: no solution yet for getting libgimp drawable proxy buffers in  the right format with space.plug-ins:- follow the GimpPrecision change.- TODO: everything else unchanged and partly broken or sub-optimal,  like setting a new image's color profile too late.app:- add enum GimpTRCType { LINEAR, NON_LINEAR, PERCEPTUAL } as  replacement for all "linear" booleans.- change gimp-babl functions to take babl spaces and GimpTRCType  parameters and support all sorts of new perceptual ~ formats.- a lot of places changed in the early days of goat invasion didn't  take advantage of gimp-babl utility functions and constructed  formats manually. They all needed revisiting and many now use much  simpler code calling gimp-babl API.- change gimp_babl_format_get_color_profile() to really extract a  newly allocated color profile from the format, and add  gimp_babl_get_builtin_color_profile() which does the same as  gimp_babl_format_get_color_profile() did before. Visited all callers  to decide whether they are looking for the format's actual profile,  or for one of the builtin profiles, simplifying code that only needs  builtin profiles.- drawables have a new get_space_api(), get_linear() is now get_trc().- images now have a "layer space" and an API to get it,  gimp_image_get_layer_format() returns formats in that space.- an image's layer space is created from the image's color profile,  change gimpimage-color-profile to deal with that correctly- change many babl_format() calls to babl_format_with_space() and take  the space from passed formats or drawables- add function gimp_layer_fix_format_space() which replaces the  layer's buffer with one that has the image's layer format, but  doesn't change pixel values- use gimp_layer_fix_format_space() to make sure layers loaded from  XCF and created by plug-ins have the right space when added to the  image, because it's impossible to always assign the right space upon  layer creation- "assign color profile" and "discard color profile" now require use  of gimp_layer_fix_format_space() too because the profile is now  embedded in all formats via the space.  Add  gimp_image_assign_color_profile() which does all that and call it  instead of a simple gimp_image_set_color_profile(), also from the  PDB set-color-profile functions, which are essentially "assign" and  "discard" calls.- generally, make sure a new image's color profile is set before  adding layers to it, gimp_image_set_color_profile() is more than  before considered know-what-you-are-doing API.- take special precaution in all places that call  gimp_drawable_convert_type(), we now must pass a new_profile from  all callers that convert layers within the same image (such as  image_convert_type, image_convert_precision), because the layer's  new space can't be determined from the image's layer format during  the call.- change all "linear" properties to "trc", in all config objects like  for levels and curves, in the histogram, in the widgets. This results  in some GUI that now has three choices instead of two.  TODO: we might want to reduce that back to two later.- keep "linear" boolean properties around as compat if needed for file  pasring, but always convert the parsed parsed boolean to  GimpTRCType.- TODO: the image's "enable color management" switch is currently  broken, will fix that in another commit.	0

KAFKA-12984: make AbstractStickyAssignor resilient to invalid input, utilize generation in cooperative, and fix assignment bug (#10985)1) Bring the generation field back to the CooperativeStickyAssignor so we don't need to rely so heavily on the ConsumerCoordinator properly updating its SubscriptionState after eg falling out of the group. The plain StickyAssignor always used the generation since it had to, so we just make sure the CooperativeStickyAssignor has this tool as well2) In case of unforeseen problems or further bugs that slip past the generation field safety net, the assignor will now explicitly look out for partitions that are being claimed by multiple consumers as owned in the same generation. Such a case should never occur, but if it does, we have to invalidate this partition from the ownedPartitions of both consumers, since we can't tell who, if anyone, has the valid claim to this partition.3) Fix a subtle bug that I discovered while writing tests for the above two fixes: in the constrained algorithm, we compute the exact number of partitions each consumer should end up with, and keep track of the "unfilled" members who must -- or might -- require more partitions to hit their quota. The problem was that members at the minQuota were being considered as "unfilled" even after we had already hit the maximum number of consumers allowed to go up to the maxQuota, meaning those minQuota members could/should not accept any more partitions beyond that. I believe this was introduced in #10509, so it shouldn't be in any released versions and does not need to be backported.Reviewers: Guozhang Wang <guozhang@apache.org>, Luke Chen <showuon@gmail.com>	1

In this commit, the implementation has not been implemented.- Resolve expression and build LogicalWindowTableAggregate. TableAggregate is added to make it different from Aggregate. The two kinds of RelNode contain different semantics. For Aggregate, it represents a relational operator that eliminates duplicates and computes totals while for TableAggregate, it can output 0 or more records for a group.- Add Plan support for window table aggregate. Logical&Physical nodes and rules are added in the commit.- Add runtime support for window table aggregate. This commit reuses the code of window aggregate and adds support for window table aggregate.- Add docs for window table aggregate.

devel-docs: add a "removed functions" table with replacement proposal.Let's start up some porting guide for plug-in developers. One of thefirst things to do is to get rid of any deprecated functions from 2.10or older versions. In the current stable, these would "just" outputwarnings, but in the dev version, all deprecated functions got removedand the build would fail.This list may not be complete. I mostly created it by some grep ondeprecated functions from libgimp 2.10.	1

[FLINK-14118][runtime] Reduce the unnecessary flushing when there is no data available for flush. (#9706)The purpose of this commit is to reduce unnecessary flushing when there is no data available for flush. More specifically, when there is exactly one BufferConsumer in the buffer queue of subpartition and no new data will be added for a while in the future (may because of just no input or the logic of the operator is to collect some data for processing and will not emit records immediately), the previous implementation will continuously notify data available (may wake up the netty thread), which is unnecessary, and eliminating these unnecessary flush can reduce CPU usage by 20% - 40% for some jobs.Benchmark results before the fix:Benchmark    Mode     Cnt     Score      Error   UnitsnetworkSkewedThroughput     thrpt    30   18240.197 ± 1892.419 ops/msAfter the fix:networkSkewedThroughput     thrpt    30   24532.313 ± 1118.312 ops/m	0

Producer / consumer behavioris sufficiently different between both implementations that it does not make sense at this pointto try and share the tests.	3

These functions are moreaccurate than using gimp_display_shell_[un]transform() and applyingthe scaling separately, in particular, when the scale matches the(horizontal or vertical) display scale.Use these functions in gimp_display_shell_draw_image(), to avoid anoff-by-one error when transforming screen-space chunks to image-space chunks, which leads to the symptoms described in the bug.Fix another potential off-by-one error affecting non-uniformlyscaled images, and window scale factors other than 1.	0

KAFKA-10661; Add new resigned state for graceful shutdown/initialization (#9531)When initializing the raft state machine after shutting down as a leader, we were previously entering the "unattached" state, which means we have no leader and no voted candidate. This was a bug because it allowed a reinitialized leader to cast a vote for a candidate in the same epoch that it was already the leader of. This patch fixes the problem by introducing a new "resigned" state which allows us to retain the leader state so that we cannot change our vote and we will not accept additional appends.This patch also revamps the shutdown logic to make use of the new "resigned" state. Previously we had a separate path in `KafkaRaftClient.poll` for the shutdown logic which resulted in some duplication. Instead now we incorporate shutdown behavior into each state's respective logic.Finally, this patch changes the shutdown logic so that `EndQuorumEpoch` is only sent by resigning leaders. Previously we allowed this request to be sent by candidates as well.Reviewers: dengziming <dengziming1993@gmail.com>, Guozhang Wang <wangguoz@gmail.com>	5

[FLINK-14400] Shrink the scope of MemoryManager from TaskExecutor to slotMemoryManager currently manages the memory bookkeeping for all slots/tasks inside one TaskExecutor.For better abstraction and isolation of slots, we can shrink its scope and make it per slot.The memory limits are fixed now per slot at the moment of slot creation. All operators, sharing the slot,will get their fixed fractional limits.In future, we might make it possible for operators to over-allocate beyond their fraction limitif there is some available free memory in the slot but it should be possible to reclaim the over-allocated memoryat any time if other operator decides to claim its fair share within its limit.	1

[AIRFLOW-179] DbApiHook string serialization fails when string contains non-ASCII charactersDear Airflow Maintainers,Please accept this PR that addresses the following issues:- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-179In addition to correctly serializing non-ASCII characters the literal transformation also corrects an issue with escaping single quotes (').Note it was my intention to add another unit test to `test_hive_to_mysql` in `tests/core.py` however on inspection the indentations of the various methods seemed wrong, methods are nested and it's not apparent what class they refer to. Additionally it seems a number of the test cases aren't related to the corresponding class.For testing purposes I simply ran a pipeline which previously failed with the following exception,    [2016-05-26 22:03:39,256] {models.py:1286} ERROR - 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 230: ordinal not in range(128)    Traceback (most recent call last):      File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/airflow/models.py", line 1245, in run    result = task_copy.execute(context=context)      File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/airflow/operators/hive_to_mysql.py", line 88, in execute    mysql.insert_rows(table=self.mysql_table, rows=results)      File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/airflow/hooks/dbapi_hook.py", line 176, in insert_rows    l.append(self._serialize_cell(cell))      File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/airflow/hooks/dbapi_hook.py", line 196, in _serialize_cell    return "'" + str(cell).replace("'", "''") + "'"      File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/future/types/newstr.py", line 102, in __new__    return super(newstr, cls).__new__(cls, value)    UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 230: ordinal not in range(128)and verified with the presence of the fix that the task succeeded and the resulting output was correct.

KAFKA-12648: introduce TopologyConfig and TaskConfig for topology-level overrides (#11272)Most configs that are read and used by Streams today originate from the properties passed in to the KafkaStreams constructor, which means they get applied universally across all threads, tasks, subtopologies, and so on. The only current exception to this is the topology.optimization config which is parsed from the properties that get passed in to StreamsBuilder#build. However there are a handful of configs that could also be scoped to the topology level, allowing users to configure each NamedTopology independently of the others, where it makes sense to do so.This PR refactors the handling of these configs by interpreting the values passed in via KafkaStreams constructor as the global defaults, which can then be overridden for individual topologies via the properties passed in when building the NamedTopology. More topology-level configs may be added in the future, but this PR covers the following:max.task.idle.mstask.timeout.msbuffered.records.per.partitiondefault.timestamp.extractor.classdefault.deserialization.exception.handlerReviewers: Guozhang Wang <wangguoz@gmail.com>, Walker Carlson <wcarlson@confluent.io>, Luke Chen <showuon@confluent.io>	5

file-jpeg: (save) Change the label for restart intervalThis was discussed in #gimp. The old label was "Frequency (rows)"which is misleading. This field is basically converted by libjpegto another value called a restart interval which is stored in aJPEG file. The restart interval specifies after how many MCUsthe restart (syncronization) marker appears in the bitstream.It is not easy to explain to a layperson what an MCU is.The value in the dialog specifies after how many *MCU rows* therestart marker appears. This is a libjpeg thing, and libjpegconverts it to the restart interval.I have merely renamed the text label of the field and PDBdescription as the current text implies pixel rows which is notthe case.A better alternative is to use the restart interval (in MCUs,not MCU rows) as saved in the file itself, which more peoplethan users of libjpeg would understand. But even that settingis not something that can easily be explained to a layperson.	1

MINOR: Remove dependence on __consumer_offsets in AdminClient listConsumerGroupsAvoid dependence on the internal __consumer_offsets topic to handle `listConsumerGroups()` since it unnecessarily requires users to have Describe access on an internal topic. Instead we query each broker independently. For most clusters, this amounts to the same thing since the default number of partitions for __consumer_offsets is 50. This also provides better encapsulation since it avoids exposing the use of __consumer_offsets, which gives us more flexibility in the future.Author: Jason Gustafson <jason@confluent.io>Reviewers: Dong Lin <lindong28@gmail.com>Closes #5007 from hachikuji/remove-admin-use-of-offsets-topic	4

Fix rendering nested task fields (#18516)When we are referring ``{{task}}` in jinja templates we can alsorefer some of the fields, which are templated. We are notable to solve all the problems with such rendering (specificallyrecursive rendering of the fields used in JINJA templating mightbe problematic. Currently whether you see original, or renderedfield depends solely on the sequence in templated_fields.However that would not even explain the rendering problemdescribed in #13559 where kwargs were defined after opargs andthe rendering of opargs **should** work. It turned out thatthe problem was with a change introduced in #8805 which madethe context effectively holds a DIFFERENT task than the currentone. Context held an original task, and the curren task wasactually a locked copy of it (to allow resolving upstreamargs before locking). As a result, any changes done byrendering templates were not visible in the task accessedvia {{ task }} jinja variable.This change replaces the the task stored in context with thesame copy that is then used later during execution so thatat least the "sequential" rendering works and templatedfields which are 'earlier' in the list of templated fieldscan be used (and render correctly) in the following fields.Fixes: #13559	0

It did not check if xcf_old_path succeeded andkept trying to load more paths even if the last one failed to load.Instead we now stop loading paths as soon as that function fails.In case we have a failure here we also try to skip to the next propertybased on the size of the path property, in hopes that the only problemwas this property.	5

Combine unit and integration test steps into one stage (#9733)This removes the barrier wait between test and integration tests in CI. This will increase capacity requirements and usage but, assuming we can meet that with autoscaler, should reduce CI times by an hour or two since we're doing all the testing in parallel.The slow path is CPU unit test -> GPU frontend tests, so kicking off the GPU frontend tests faster should help decrease CI runtime.Co-authored-by: driazati <driazati@users.noreply.github.com>	1

app: Add a 'restore_func' to GimpDialogFactoryEntryIn gimp_session_info_restore() there is code to create a dialog from asession info. GimpSessionInfo lives in the widgets module. Thus wecan't add restoration code that depends on a higher level module. Inparticular, we can't add code to restore docks in an GimpImageWindowsince GimpImageWindow lives in the display module. And we need suchcode to be able to restore a single-window mode session.Since dialogs are defined in the dialogs module, it makes sense toalso have the code that restores a dialog in that module.So, add a 'restore_func' member to GimpRestoreDialogFunc of typeGimpRestoreDialogFunc and move the code there.	4

plug-ins: fix #7195 Exporting multilayer TIFF with EXIF saves some layers twiceIf you first open a multi page TIFF, exiv2 generates EXIF tags for thefirst 3 pages in the form of Exif.Image.<tags>, Exif.Image2.<tags>,Exif.Image3.<tags>. When exporting with EXIF saving enabled, exiv2 thinksit needs to save TIFF pages for the EXIF metadata of the second and thirdpage too. Those pages saved by exiv2 contain only metadata no real imagedata and give warnings when loading.The EXIF tags read from page 2 and 3 are only the basic image specs. Wedon't use those, nor do we add tags to it. Until we support handling ofmetadata for those pages and exiv2 has better support for all TIFF pagesbeyond the first few, I see no reason to save this information.So for now lets just delete all tags that start with Exif.Image followedby a number.	5

[FLINK-13765][task] Introduce the TwoInputSelectionHandler for selecting input in StreamTwoInputSelectableProcessorIn StreamTwoInputSelectableProcessor there are three fields {InputSelectable, InputSelection, availableInputsMask} tobe used together for the function of selecting next available input index.From design aspect, these fields can be abstracted into a separate component called TwoInputSelectionHandler, which ispassed into the constructor of StreamTwoInputSelectableProcessor as a final field. So the internal implementation detailsof TwoInputSelectionHandler is hidden from processor view which only needs to interact with exposed methods from selection handler.Another tiny benefit is that we make the StreamTwoInputSelectableProcessor a bit because two methods are removed from it.	4

Issue #7685: g-ir-doc-tool produces broken XML.To work around the issue, I just wrote a stupid sed script.

Just a temporary hack.See: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gobject-introspection/-/issues/425Also fixing this issue, I encountered another bug, this time in meson,which changes backslashes in slashes on 'command' arguments, in acompletely uninvited manner! The only workaround to this is apparentlyto call an external script, which is ridiculous for such a basic stuff.But well… here is why I implement this with a script, instead ofdirectly calling sed in the meson 'command'.See: https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/issues/1564	0

[AutoTVM, Relay] Clear compile engine after task extraction (#5724)	4
Consistent DB upgrade/downgrade arguments (#22537)This is a follow up to #22102, and be forewarned, this might be a bikeshed. If this gets contentious at all, I'll just close it and move on.I think it's a little bit easier for users to have consistent flags/arguments for the `airflow db upgrade` and `airflow db downgrade` commands. This PR just tweaks the argument processing to expect `--to-revision` and `--to-version` instead of `--revision` and `--version`, respectively.That change makes the arguments to those commands more consistent with the `--from-revision` and `--from-version` arguments. Doing so also avoids overloading the `--version` flag, which is usually a flag that prints out the version information of the command itself (eg: Airflow's version, which is available via `airflow version`).An argument against this change is that the `--to-...` arguments can be understood to be implied, like this:```bashairflow db upgrade --from-version 10.15.8  # Upgrade from 10.15.8 to the current Airflow version```and this means that you do not necessarily need to always specify the `--to-...` arguments. By having both `--to-` and `--from-` arguments, users might think that they always need to specify both a `--to-` and `--from-` argument.I also fixed an unrelated grammar typo, which corrects the grammar used to log the operation.	2

[Relay] Support 'external codegen targets'. (#11173)* [Relay] Support 'external codegen targets'.(Part of Collage, https://github.com/apache/tvm-rfcs/blob/main/rfcs/0062-collage.md)This change prepares the VM and Relay target handling machinery to supportexternal codegen targets in addition to 'regular' targets. This allows usto configure the build with Collage as follows:```    host_target = tvm.target.Target("llvm")    targets = [tvm.target.Target("cuda", host_target),               tvm.target.Target("cutlass", host_target),               tvm.target.Target("cudnn", host_target)]    with tvm.transform.PassContext(...):        exe = tvm.relay.vm.compile(module, target=targets)```Four changes are required:1. I introduce four new target kinds for the external codegens currently supported   by Collage. Others can be added as they are vetted for use by Collage. These   are given a device type matching the external codegen's assumption (ie just CUDA   currently), and given a target kind attribute "is_external_codegen" of True. The   latter is needed by Collage to signal the target kind name represents and external   codegen 'compiler' name. See the RFC for specifics.2. I introduce the binary relation Target::IsExternalCodegenFor so that   external codegen targets can be related back to the 'underlying' targets   they are implicitly using in their codegen.3. I rework the VMCompiler and BuildModule interfaces to accept an Array<Target> of   'raw targets' instead of a Map<Integer, Target>. This more general representation   is needed because we may now have multiple targets of the same device type   active simultaneously. I add new static methods on the Python Target to   convert to this form in a way that mimics check_and_update_host_consist.4. I rework CompilationConfig to work from Array<Target> directly, to not depend   on the host_target argument (since dealt with on the Python side), and to   understand that if we have two targets for the same device type the non-external   codegen target takes precedence.The change to CompilationConfig seems neutral with respect to the recent discussionson compilation configuration representation and tvmc.I made a few attempts to remove Target.check_and_update_host_const entirely in favorof using CompilationConfig as the definitive target handling choke point but backedout once they became too large.* - Working on unit tests* - Fix two Debug-only failures* - Use Array<Target> in GraphExecutorCodegen/AOTExecutorCodegen ifaces instead  of CompilationConfig (don't want to bake it into any official APIs).- Started unit tests.* - Lints* - Moar Lints* - Fix some unit tests* - Fix last unit test failures* - whitespace* - Address Eric's comments.

[FLINK-10774] Rework lifecycle management of partitionDiscoverer in FlinkKafkaConsumerBase	2
[FLINK-16972][network] LocalBufferPool eagerly fetches global segments to ensure proper availability.Before this commit, availability of LocalBufferPool depended on a the availability of a shared NetworkBufferPool. However, if multiple LocalBufferPools simultaneously are available only because the NetworkBufferPool becomes available with one segment, only one of the LocalBufferPools is truly available (the one that actually acquires this segment).The solution in this commit is to define availability only through the guaranteed ability to provide a memory segment to the consumer. If a LocalBufferPool runs out of local segments it will become unavailable until it receives a segment from the NetworkBufferPool. To minimize unavailability, LocalBufferPool first tries to eagerly fetch new segments before declaring unavailability and if that fails, the local pool subscribes to the availability to the network pool to restore availability asap.Additionally, LocalBufferPool would switch to unavailable only after it could not serve a requested memory segment. For requestBufferBuilderBlocking that is too late as it entered the blocking loop already.Finally, LocalBufferPool now permanently holds at least one buffer. To reflect that, the number of required segments needs to be at least one, which matches all usages in production code. A few test needed to be adjusted to properly capture the new requirement.	1

MINOR: Do not wait for first line of console consumer output since we now have a more reliable test using JMXWaiting for the first line of output was added in KAFKA-2527 when JmxMixin was originally added as a heuristic todetermine when the process was ready. We've since determined this is not good enough given JmxTool's limitationsand now include a separate, more reliable check before starting JmxTool. This check is also dangerous since aconsumer that is started before data is available in the topic, it won't output anything to stdout and only logserrors to a separate log file. This means we may have a long delay between starting the process and starting JMXmonitoring.Since we have a more reliable check for liveness via JMX now (and in cases that need it, partition assignmentmetrics via JMX), we should no longer need to wait for the first line of output.Author: Ewen Cheslack-Postava <me@ewencp.org>Reviewers: Ismael Juma <ismael@juma.me.uk>, Apurva Mehta <apurva@confluent.io>Closes #3447 from ewencp/dont-wait-first-line-console-consumer	5

KAFKA-4317: Regularly checkpoint StateStore changelog offsetsCurrently the checkpoint file is deleted at state store initialization and it is only ever written again during a clean shutdown. This can result in significant delays during restarts as the entire store needs to be loaded from the changelog.We can mitigate against this by frequently checkpointing the offsets. The checkpointing happens only during the commit phase, i.e, after we have manually flushed the store and the producer. So we guarantee that the checkpointed offsets are never greater than what has been flushed.In the event of hard failure we can recover by reading the checkpoints and consuming from the stored offsets.Author: Damian Guy <damian.guy@gmail.com>Reviewers: Eno Thereska, Matthias J.

KAFKA-1860: Fix issue that file system errors are not detected unless Kafka tries to write.When the disk (raid with caches dir) dies on a Kafka broker, typically the filesystem gets mounted into read-only mode, and hence when Kafka tries to read the disk, they'll get a FileNotFoundException with the read-only errno set (EROFS). However, as long as there is no produce request received, hence no writes attempted on the disks, Kafka will not exit on such FATAL error and keep on throwing exception : java.io.FileNotFoundExceptionIn this case, the JVM should stop if the underlying file system goes in to Read only mode.Author: MayureshGharat <gharatmayuresh15@gmail.com>Reviewers: Lin Dong, Gwen Shapira, Ismael Juma, Guozhang WangCloses #698 from MayureshGharat/KAFKA-1860	5

Revert "KAFKA-7077: Use default producer settings in Connect Worker (#11475)" (#11932)This reverts commit 76cf7a5793702b55e2cfd98a375f8f1708ff32c3.Connect already allows users to enable idempotent producers for connectors and the Connect workers. Although Kafka producers enabled idempotency by default in 3.0, due to compatibility requirements and the fact that [KIP-318](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-318%3A+Make+Kafka+Connect+Source+idempotent) hasn't been explicitly approved, the changes here are reverted.

[TFLite] Add option to overwrite OperatorConverter class in relay.frontend.from_tflite (#9256)* [TFLite] Relay Frontend: Add option to overwrite OperatorConverter classThis allows to overwrite the mapping from TFLite Operators to TVM Relay Operators from external python scripts. This has the following advantages:- Adding support for unsupported builtin or even custom operators by adding a hand-written convert function- Enables overwriting of existing convert functions for supported operators by alternative implementations (useful for currently unsupported edge cases)Example Usage:```class CustomOperatorConverter(relay.frontend.tflite.OperatorConverter):    def __init__(self, model, subgraph, exp_tab):        super(CustomOperatorConverter, self).__init__(model, subgraph, exp_tab)        convert_map_overwrite = {"SUB": self.convert_sub_custom}        self.convert_map.update(convert_map_overwrite)    def convert_sub_custom(self, op):        ......relay_mod = relay.frontend.from_tflite(    tflite_model, shape_dict=shape_dict, dtype_dict=dtype_dict, op_converter=CustomOperatorConverter)```[TFLite] Make sure that even DETECTION_POSTPROCESS op can be overwrittenThis is desirable, because the current implementation of this CUSTOM op is incompatible with MicroTVM targets* Tests: added test case for overwriting op_converter in TFLite relay frontendKept the test as simple as possible by only comparing 2 differentimplementations of a SUB TFLite operator:1. Original: c = a - b2. Dummy: c = a + (-b)Comparison with TFLite reference output is not necessary because tis isalready covered by other test cases. Instead comparisons of the two TVMmodels are used.	1

[TIR][StorageRewrite] Allow in-place buffer reuse of non-flat memory (#12655)* [TIR][StorageRewrite] Allow in-place buffer reuse of non-flat memoryPreviously, shared buffer use was entirely disabled for non-flatmemory, since the existing checks for shared memory assume flat 1-dspaces.  This was enforced in `FindAlloc` and validated in`PrepareNewAlloc`.  The validation in `PrepareNewAlloc` could trigger,if the buffer sharing was due to an in-place operation, and notthrough the `FindAlloc` function.In-place operations do not require N-d packing, nor do they introduceambiguity in how different code generators may interpret non-flatphysical indices.  Therefore, this commit relaxes the validation in`PrepareNewAlloc`, allowing buffer reuse of non-flat buffers forin-place operations.* Update new StorageRewrite with correct allocate/buffer_decl usage	1

KAFKA-9373: Reduce shutdown time by avoiding unnecessary loading of indexes (#8346)KAFKA-7283 enabled lazy mmap on index files by initializing indiceson-demand rather than performing costly disk/memory operations whencreating all indices on broker startup.

However, segment indices are still created on closingsegments, regardless of whether they need to be closed or not.This is a cleaned up version of #7900, which was submitted by @efeg. Iteliminates unnecessary disk accesses and memory map operations whiledeleting, renaming or closing offset and time indexes.In a cluster with 31 brokers, where each broker has 13K to 20K segments,@efeg and team observed up to 2 orders of magnitude faster LogManagershutdown times - i.e. dropping the LogManager shutdown time of eachbroker from 10s of seconds to 100s of milliseconds.To avoid confusion between `renameTo` and `setFile`, I replaced thelatter with the more restricted updateParentDir` (it turns out that'sall we need).Reviewers: Jun Rao <junrao@gmail.com>, Andrew Choi <a24choi@edu.uwaterloo.ca>Co-authored-by: Adem Efe Gencer <agencer@linkedin.com>Co-authored-by: Ismael Juma <ismael@juma.me.uk>	2

MINOR: Close ZooKeeperClient if waitUntilConnected fails during construction (#5411)This has always been an issue, but the recent upgrade to ZooKeeper3.4.13 means it is also an issue when an unresolvable ZKaddress is used, causing some tests to leak threads.The change in behaviour in ZK 3.4.13 is that no exception is thrownfrom the ZooKeeper constructor in case of an unresolvable address.Instead, ZooKeeper tries to re-resolve the address hoping it becomesresolvable again. We eventually throw a`ZooKeeperClientTimeoutException`, which is similar to the casewhere the the address is resolvable but ZooKeeper is notreachable.Reviewers: Ismael Juma <ismael@juma.me.uk>	1

Fix: ``TaskInstance`` does not show ``queued_by_job_id`` & ``external_executor_id`` (#17179)**Problem discovery:**I was debugging a bug with the `external_executor_id` Airflow after which this UI bug caught my eye and I got annoyed by it. I figured to fix this one first so my other testing can go a bit smoother :)**Description of the problem:**Currently there is a BUG inside the Task Instance details (/task) view.It loads the TaskInstance by calling `TI(task, execution_date)` and then uses `refresh_from_db()` to refresh many fields that are no filled in yet.However, the assumption is made in that case that it refreshes all values, which it does not.`external_executor_id` and `queued_by_job_id` are not updated at all and `executor_config` is only instantiated by the original `TI(task, execution_date)` call but also not updated in `refresh_from_db()`.This also shows in the UI where these values are always showing None, while the TaskInstance view shows you these values are not None.**The changes in the PR:**1. Changes to the `update_from_db()` method to include the missing three values.2. A new test that checks we are really updating ALL values in `update_from_db()`3. Removal of an incorrect comment as we do need the `execution_date` for that view.	5
Changes to make tensorize work. These changes also fix the previously broken test. (#3981)* Changes to make tensorize work.

The fix for this tojust find all the vars in expr in relace them with some const value.2) Equivalence between tensorized expr and one being asked to tensorize. For example,the error would be.TVMError: Check failed: Equal(lhs, rhs):Failed to match the compute with TensorIntrin tensor_intrin's declarationprovided= reduce(combiner=comm_reducer(result=[(x + y)], lhs=[x], rhs=[y], identity_element=[(int16)0]), source=[(int16(data(k))*int16(kernel(((((((((k.outer.outer*64) + (k.outer.inner*2)) + k)/2)*128) + i) - (k.outer.inner*128)) - (k.outer.outer*4096)), ((((k.outer.outer*64) + (k.outer.inner*2)) + k) % 2))))], axis=[iter_var(k, range(min=0, ext=2))], where=(bool)1, value_index=0),intrin=  reduce(combiner=comm_reducer(result=[(x + y)], lhs=[x], rhs=[y], identity_element=[(int16)0]), source=[(int16(data(k))*int16(kernel(i, k)))], axis=[iter_var(k, range(min=0, ext=2))], where=(bool)1, value_index=0)Difference is mainly in the source part:source=[(int16(data(k))*int16(kernel(((((((((k.outer.outer*64) + (k.outer.inner*2)) + k)/2)*128) + i) - (k.outer.inner*128)) - (k.outer.outer*4096)), ((((k.outer.outer*64) + (k.outer.inner*2)) + k) % 2))))]source=[(int16(data(k))*int16(kernel(i, k)))], axis=[iter_var(k, range(min=0, ext=2))]This was not being simpifiled due to compute_intrin_iter_space (map foriter var to range) not containing leaf iter vars.3) Here it fails with:Check failed: is_one(Simplify(value->shape[i])): Argument b_buffer shape mismatch[16, 4] vs [(((((ax1.outer*16) + 15)/16) + 1) - ax1.outer), (((((k.outer*4) + 3)/4) + 1) - k.outer), 16, 4]This is in buffer binding where it thinks expected and buffer boundshape is different.

app: remove the hackish "button_press_before_focus" from GimpDisplayShelland simply *always* set the tool to the right state before sending ita button_press. GimpTool's state setting functions are now smartenough to simply ignore setting the same state again. When recieving aFOCUS_IN, skip state setting when the pointer is grabbed, which is asafe indicator for tool interaction going on. This hopefully fixesstates for both click-to-focus and focus-follows-mouse *and* fixes thepreviously warning case where a new image was opened into an alreadyfocussed canvas (the warning then happened on button press, and thetool was in an inconsistent state).	2

build: do not build Windows dependencies with ccache.The build rules were highly inspired by other projects on GNOME'sGitlab. All of them used to build with ccache. It worked fine for themain build, but completely broke GObject Introspection build on bothbabl and GEGL. And the worse thing is that meson was absolutely notdisplaying the error, just saying it failed (even in verbose mode). Alot of time wasted trying to debug.Therefore let's get rid of ccache, but only for babl and GEGL. Keep itfor GIMP itself as it works fine there.Other minor changes:* Build from the build dir, rather than source. The other way around  works too, but I actually find commands simpler this way.* Adding artifacts.	1

Issue #1714 - When GIMP starts, default brush hardness is always at 100We should not have essential signal connections (such as setting tooloptions from brush properties) implemented in the tool options GUIfiles, because they are not active until the options GUI is created.Also, that magic is simply too hidden in the options GUI files.Move the signal connections and the brush property copying code togimppaintoptions.c where is can also be done cleaner.However, this must only be done for the main tool options instancethat is used for the GUI. Therefore, add a "gui_mode" boolean toGimpToolOptions and set it to TRUE for all main tool options.(this is ugly, but much less ugly and much less hidden than all theplaces where code lives (like tool_manager.c) that can now be movedinto GimpToolOptions and its subclasses, and implemented cleanlythere).	4
KAFKA-9089; Reassignment should be resilient to unexpected errors (#7562)The purpose of this patch is to make the reassignment algorithm simpler and more resilient to unexpected errors. Specifically, it has the following improvements:1. Remove `ReassignedPartitionContext`. We no longer need to track the previous reassignment through the context and we now use the assignment state as the single source of truth for the target replicas in a reassignment.2. Remove the intermediate assignment state when overriding a previous reassignment. Instead, an overriding reassignment directly updates the assignment state and shuts down any unneeded replicas. Reassignments are _always_ persisted in Zookeeper before being updated in the controller context.3. To fix race conditions with concurrent submissions, reassignment completion for a partition always checks for a zk partition reassignment to be removed. This means the controller no longer needs to track the source of the reassignment.4. Api reassignments explicitly remove reassignment state from zk prior to beginning the new reassignment. This fixes an inconsistency in precedence. Upon controller failover, zookeeper reassignments always take precedence over any active reassignment. So if we do not have the logic to remove the zk reassignment when an api reassignment is triggered, then we can revert to the older zk reassignment.Reviewers: Viktor Somogyi <viktorsomogyi@gmail.com>, Stanislav Kozlovski <stanislav_kozlovski@outlook.com>, Jun Rao <junrao@gmail.com>	4

app, libgimp, pdb, plug-ins: allow pasting multiple full layers.When a selection exists, we are copying then pasting the selectioncontents. In particular, with multi-layer selection, it means pasting amerged result of the selected layers (like a sample merged but limitedto selected layers).Yet when no selection exists, with a single layer selected, a cut inparticular would remove the layer fully, then a paste would copy itelsewhere (in the same image or even on a different image). This wasstill working, but not with multiple layers. This is now fixed and wecan now copy/cut then paste several layers (without merge), which issometimes a very practical way to move layers (sometimes simpler thandrag'n drop, especially between images).As a consequence, the PDB function gimp_edit_paste() now also returns anarray of layers (not a single layer).	2

As a side-effect of increasing this minimum version, the feature level values decreased by one.Reviewers: Jason Gustafson <jason@confluent.io>, Jun Rao <junrao@gmail.com>	5

The librabbitmq library stopped installing for python3.7 (#8853)When preparing backport relases I found that rabbitmq was notincluded in the "devel_ci" extras. It turned out that librabbitmq wasnot installing in python3.7 and the reason it turned out to bethat librabbitmq is not maintained for 2 years already and ithas been replaced by py-amqp library. The pythhon py-amqplibrary has been improved using cython compilation, so itbecame production ready and librabbitmq has been abandoned.We are switching to the py-amqp library here and addingrabbitmq back to "devel_ci" dependencies.Details in: https://github.com/celery/librabbitmq/issues/153	0

Make auto refresh interval configurable (#18107)closes: #18069We accidentally DDOS'd our own webserver yesterday 😄 More details in the issue on how exactly this happened, but the gist is that auto-refresh can be a significant strain if there are many active tasks whose statuses must be polled. Auto-refresh is a wonderful feature but we wanted to be able to lengthen the interval to protect against this.On main, the interval is hard-coded to 3 seconds. I'm proposing we add a new webserver config variable that will allow this interval to be customized.	1

[FLINK-3336] Add Rescale Data Shipping for DataStreamThis is the Javadoc of DataStream.rescale() that describes thebehaviour:Sets the partitioning of the {@link DataStream} so that the output elementsare distributed evenly to a subset of instances of the next operation in a round-robinfashion.The subset of downstream operations to which the upstream operation sendselements depends on the degree of parallelism of both the upstream and downstream operation.For example, if the upstream operation has parallelism 2 and the downstream operationhas parallelism 4, then one upstream operation would distribute elements to twodownstream operations while the other upstream operation would distribute to the othertwo downstream operations. If, on the other hand, the downstream operation has parallelism2 while the upstream operation has parallelism 4 then two upstream operations willdistribute to one downstream operation while the other two upstream operations willdistribute to the other downstream operations.In cases where the different parallelisms are not multiples of each other one or severaldownstream operations will have a differing number of inputs from upstream operations.	1

app: in GimpTransformGridTool, allow simultaneous forward and backward transformsIn GimpTransformGridTool, allow performing simultaneous forward(normal) and backward (corrective) transforms, by having eachtransform direction operate on an independent set of parameters.In other words, whereas the transform-grid tools previously had asingle transform, which could be applied either normally orcorrectively using the "direction" tool-option, they now have twoindependent transforms, one applied normally and the otherapplied correctively, which are toggled using the "direction"option.  The overall transform is the combination of the backwardtransform, followed by the forward transform.Another way to think about it, is that the tool transforms a sourceshape into a destination shape.  The source shape is defined by thebackward transform, and the destination shape is defined by theforward transform.  Wherewas previously only one of these shapescould be controlled (the other shape always being the item bounds),it's now possible to control both shapes in a single transform.The next commit will allow modifying both shapes simultaneously,making this even more useful.Note that since both transforms start off as the identity, usingonly one of the transform directions has the same behavior asbefore.	1

[FLINK-19801][checkpoint] Using lazy initialization of aux structure while creating InflightDataRescalingDescriptor.For rescaling unaligned checkpoints, rescaling descriptors need to be calculated. However, for larger setups, it can take a while to calculate mappings and thus it should be avoided for all aligned checkpoints, interchanges without data, and for trivial setup (simple upscaling of shuffles).There were some optimizations already in the code but it relied on determining the simple cases in advance, which is quite complicated and fell short in two regards. In certain cases, such as channels that or filled only on either upstream or downstream, it was too aggressive and lead to wrong results. Further, some optimization opportunities were left out.This commit also generalizes RescaledChannelMapping to RescaleMappings to be additionally used for subtask mappings.In this refactoring, the calculation of most aux structure is lazy to simplify the detection of the cases. Accordingly, most calculations are moved inside TaskStateAssignment and properly encapsulated.	4

[BYOC] Switch TensorRT BYOC integration to IRModule-at-a-time using RelayToTIR hook (#11979)* [BYOC] Switch TensorRT BYOC integration to IRModule-at-a-time using RelayToTIR hookThis does for the TensorRT integration what #11631 did for the CUTLASS integration.- All compilation options are captured within the attributes of a Target of  kind "tensorrt" (instead of the "relay.ext.tensorrt.options" attribute in  PassContext). This means all BYOC configurations options needed by Collage can  be captured uniformly by a list-of-Targets. It also means RPC boundaries (as used  internally at OctoML) only need to worry about maintaining the fidelity of the  Target instance(s) rather than reaching into the PassContext.- Compilation is switched from function-at-a-time (relying on the TECompiler) to  IRModule-at-a-time (using the RelayToTIR target-specific hook mechanism). Though  not strictly necessary for Collage I want to check the path is now clear to  deprecate the support for BYOC in TEComplier.- Get all the TensorRT tests going again, except for a few I've disabled with  x-link to a new issue #11765. CAUTION: The TensorRT runtime is not supported in  CI so many of these tests are cosmetic.- While trying to track down a 'free(): invalid pointer' error in test_tensorrt_int8_exp.py  made the TensorRT allocs/frees more robust, but turns out its also broken in main.

Fixes "development" and "rc" cross dependencies between providers (#17023)In case we have additional dependencies between providers releasedat the same time (for example we need to release sftp and sshpackages now where sftp package depends on release of sshat the same time) we have to add suffix to the version of theadditional_dependency.PIP does not take into account unfortunately that developmentdependencies should likely be considered as fulfilling therequirement of >=. For example if you have:sftp depends on ssh>=2.1.0 and you release ssh 2.1.0.dev0 atthe same time the ssh>=2.1.0 condition is not fulfilled.Same case will be with rc1. Therefore we need to add the suffix in suchcross-provider dependencies to be able to install them in CIand in rc candidates.In the future we might ask PIP to change behaviour in such case.	4

KAFKA-9422: Track the set of topics a connector is using (KIP-558) (#8017)This feature corresponds to KIP-558 and extends how the internal status topic (set via `status.storage.topic` distributed worker config) is used to include information that allows Kafka Connect to keep track which topics a connector is using.The set of topics a connector is actively using, is exposed via a new endpoint that is added to the REST API of Connect workers.* A `GET /connectors/{name}/topics` request will return the set of topics that have been recorded as active since a connector started or since the set of topics was reset for this connector.An additional endpoints allows users to reset the set of active topics for a connector via the second endpoint that this feature is adding:* A `PUT /connectors/{name}/topics/reset` request clears the set of active topics. An operator may enable or disable this feature by setting `topic.tracking.enable` (true by default).The `topic.tracking.enable` worker config property (true by default) allows an operator to enable/disable the entire feature. Or if the feature is enabled, the `topic.tracking.allow.reset` worker config property (true by default) allows an operator to control whether reset requests submitted to the Connect REST API are allowed.Author: Konstantine Karantasis <konstantine@confluent.io>Reviewer: Randall Hauch <rhauch@gmail.com>	5

Issue #6886: fix loading PNG images with linear profile or gAMA chunk.Our main issue is that GIMP does not accept indexed images with linearbackend. MR !460 was an attempt to fix this, but some weird pixel dataconversions were happening so the result was very wrong.We could try to investigate this and add support for linear RGB palettecolors, but it's unclear how necessary it is (i.e. is there any indexedimage format for which we'd want this? PNG is not one such format aswill be explained below), especially that palette are u8 only right nowand linear RGB u8 is not the best idea anyway.In cases reported in #6886 though, our code would say the input islinear mostly because it had a 1.0 gAMA chunk (or we could have a casewith a linear profile too). But then we don't need to set such data asbeing in linear RGB. Just set it as non-linear RGB (R'G'B') with theassociated linear profile and that's it.Setting a linear backend to an imported PNG would only be useful if PNGhad some flag explicitly asking for this, bypassing any profile TRC. Butas far as I can see in its spec, there is no such thing.	2

Bug 781020 - GIMP UI vector icons are drawn way too small.Though the bug was mostly fixed, it seems to still happen on Windows XP,where apparently no content type had been registered for SVG.GTK+ developers don't seem too keen to patch GTK+ 2.24 for a platformwhich they don't support anymore.Also if not mistaken, GIMP does not officially support Windows XPanymore either. A patch though has already been provided by Edward E.and it really doesn't look like it could break anything since it justadds a last "else if" when everything else failed (and inside a #ifdefaffecting only WIN32 builds).So let's just add it in our builds at least. We still don't have supportfor it, but I see no reason to just refuse a minor patch which won'tbreak anything else.	4

KAFKA-8386; Use COORDINATOR_NOT_AVAILABLE error when group is Dead (#6762)The Dead state in the coordinator is used for groups which are either pending deletion or migration to a new coordinator. Currently requests received while in this state result in an UNKNOWN_MEMBER_ID which causes consumers to reset the memberId. This is a problem for KIP-345 since it can cause an older member to fence a newer member. This patch changes the error code returned in this state to COORDINATOR_NOT_AVAILABLE, which causes the consumer to rediscover the coordinator, but not reset the memberId.Reviewers: Guozhang Wang <wangguoz@gmail.com>, Jason Gustafson <jason@confluent.io>	5

KAFKA-10723: Fix LogManager shutdown error handling (#9596)The asynchronous shutdown in LogManager has the shortcoming that if during shutdown any of the internal futures fail, then we do not always ensure that all futures are completed before LogManager.shutdown returns. This is because, this line in the finally clause shuts down the thread pools asynchronously. As a result, despite the shut down completed message from KafkaServer is seen in the error logs, some futures continue to run from inside LogManager attempting to close some logs. This is misleading during debugging. Also sometimes it introduces an avoidable post-shutdown activity where resources (such as file handles) are released or persistent state is checkpointed in the Broker.In this PR, we fix the above behavior such that we prevent leakage of threads. If any of the futures throw an error, we skip creating of checkpoint and clean shutdown file only for the affected log directory. We continue to wait for all futures to complete for all the directories.Reviewers: Ismael Juma <ismael@juma.me.uk>, Jun Rao <junrao@gmail.com>	2
KAFKA-7652: Part II; Add single-point query for SessionStore and use for flushing / getter (#6161)#2972 tried to fix a bug about flushing operation, but it was not complete, since findSessions(key, earliestEnd, latestStart) does not guarantee to only return a single entry since its semantics are to return any sessions whose end > earliestEnd and whose start < latestStart.I've tried various ways to fix it completely and I ended up having to add a single-point query to the public ReadOnlySessionStore API for the exact needed semantics. It is used for flushing to read the old values (otherwise the wrong old values will be sent downstreams, hence it is a correctness issue) and also for getting the value for value-getters (it is for perf only).	1

KAFKA-5310; reset ControllerContext during resignationThis ticket is all about ControllerContext initialization and teardown. The key points are:1. we should teardown ControllerContext during resignation instead of waiting on election to fix it up. A heapdump shows that the former controller keeps pretty much all of its ControllerContext state laying around.2. we don't properly teardown/reset ControllerContext.partitionsBeingReassigned. This can cause problems when the former controller becomes re-elected as controller at a later point in time.Suppose a partition assignment is initially R0. Now suppose a reassignment R1 gets stuck during controller C0 and an admin tries to "undo" R1 (by deleting /admin/partitions_reassigned, deleting /controller, and submitting another reassignment specifying R0). The new controller C1 may succeed with R0. If the controller moves back to C0, it will then reattempt R1 even though that partition reassignment has been cleared from zookeeper prior to shifting the controller back to C0. This results in the actual partition reassignment in zookeeper being unexpectedly changed back to R1.Author: Onur Karaman <okaraman@linkedin.com>Reviewers: Jun Rao <junrao@gmail.com>Closes #3122 from onurkaraman/KAFKA-5310	2

KAFKA-10134: Use long poll if we do not have fetchable partitions (#8934)The intention of using poll(0) is to not block on rebalance but still return some data; however, `updateAssignmentMetadataIfNeeded` have three different logic: 1) discover coordinator if necessary, 2) join-group if necessary, 3) refresh metadata and fetch position if necessary. We only want to make 2) to be non-blocking but not others, since e.g. when the coordinator is down, then heartbeat would expire and cause the consumer to fetch with timeout 0 as well, causing unnecessarily high CPU.Since splitting this function is a rather big change to make as a last minute blocker fix for 2.6, so I made a smaller change to make updateAssignmentMetadataIfNeeded has an optional boolean flag to indicate if 2) above should wait until either expired or complete, otherwise do not wait on the join-group future and just poll with zero timer.Reviewers: Jason Gustafson <jason@confluent.io>	5

Fix stack overflow when partially-__init__ Node raises exception. (#7481)* Fix stack overflow when partially-__init__ Node raises exception. * If a Node subclass raises an exception and ctypes is in use before   __init_handle_by_constructor__ is called (or self.handle is   otherwise set), a Python stack overflow could result. This is   because the unset handle slot causes self.handle accesses to   fallback on the getattr(self, 'handle') method, invoking   NodeGetAttr. * Then I believe this causes an infinite loop. * The fix is to make Node.__getattr__ raise AttributeError for all   attributes in __slots__, then make __del__ tolerant to missing   self.handle. * I don't believe cython is affected because it implements a   descriptor to access its underlying chandle and that shouldn't be unset.* black format* actually use handle instead of self.handle	0

Fixes problem where conf variable was used before initialization (#16088)There was a problem that when we initialized configuration, we've runvalidate() which - among others - checkd if the connection is an `sqlite`but when the SQLAlchemy connection was not configured via variable butvia secret manager, it has fallen back to secret_backend, which shouldbe configured via conf and initialized.The problem is that the "conf" object is not yet created, becausethe "validate()" method has not finished yet and"initialize_configuration" has not yet returned.This led to snake eating its own tail.This PR defers the validate() method to after secret backends havebeen initialized. The effect of it is that secret backends mightbe initialized with configuration that is not valid, but there areno real negative consequences of this.Fixes: #16079Fixes: #15685starting	0

KAFKA-8483/KAFKA-8484; Ensure safe handling of producerId resets (#6883)The idempotent producer attempts to detect spurious UNKNOWN_PRODUCER_ID errors and handle them by reassigning sequence numbers to the inflight batches. The inflight batches are tracked in a PriorityQueue. The problem is that the reassignment of sequence numbers depends on the iteration order of PriorityQueue, which does not guarantee any ordering. So this can result in sequence numbers being assigned in the wrong order.  This patch fixes the problem by using a sorted set instead of a priority queue so that the iteration order preserves the sequence order. Note that resetting sequence numbers is an exceptional case.This patch also fixes KAFKA-8484, which can cause an IllegalStateException when the producerId is reset while there are pending produce requests inflight. The solution is to ensure that sequence numbers are only reset if the producerId of a failed batch corresponds to the current producerId.Reviewers: Guozhang Wang <wangguoz@gmail.com>	0

[MINOR] Consolidate in-memory/rocksdb unit tests for window & session store (#6677)Consolidated the unit tests by having {RocksDB/InMemory}{Window/Session}StoreTest extend {Window/Session}BytesStoreTest. Besides some implementation-specific tests (eg involving segment maintenance) all tests were moved to the abstract XXXBytesStoreTest class. The test coverage now is a superset of the original test coverage for each store type.The only difference made to existing tests (besides moving them) was to switch from list-based equality comparison to set based, in order to reflect that the stores make no guarantees regarding the ordering of records returned from a range fetch.There are some implementation-specific tests that were left in the corresponding test class. The RocksDBWindowStoreTest, for example, had several tests pertaining to segments and/or the underlying filesystem. Another key difference is that the in-memory versions should delete expired records aggressively, while the RocksDB versions should only remove entirely expired segments.Reviewers: John Roesler <john@confluent.io>, Guozhang Wang <wangguoz@gmail.com>	5

After a weekend of extensive mail exchange with the signal crew, we2000-05-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>After a weekend of extensive mail exchange with the signal crew,we finally found that #2742 is not a Gimp bug but a real OSF/1bug. OSF/1 does _not_ reliably restart read() and write() callson certain slow devices (pipes).* libgimp/gimpwire.[ch]: guard all read/write calls on the wirewith loops checking for EINTR. This has to be done "manually"as glib's GIOChannels return G_IO_ERROR_UNKNOWN on the occurenceof EINTR (which is a bug, too).s/int/gboolean and minor cleanups while I was on it (not changingany logic).This fix depends on the current (broken) state of the GIOChannelimplementation and is scheduled for removal as soon as glibbehaves nicely here.Left SA_RESTART there for the moment in app/main.c. See it asdefensive programming or just my fear to change two #2742-relatedplaces at the same time. We might choose to remove SA_RESTARTlater. Many thanks again to Austin, Garry and Tim.	4

[Collage] CollagePartition pass (#12086)* [Collage] CollagePartition passSee https://github.com/apache/tvm-rfcs/blob/main/rfcs/0062-collage.md.This adds the main CollagePartition pass, which: 1. Inspects all the targets in the CompilationConfig and builds    PartitionSpecs describing how to generate speculative CandidatePartitions    for them. 2. Runs the above rules on the model to collect all the candidates. 3. Eliminates candidates whose target contradicts any constraints already    imposed by, eg, device planning. 4. Eagerly estimates the cost of each candidate. 5. Performs a shortest path search to chose an 'optimal' set of candidate    partitions so as to minimize estimated model latency, such that every sub-expression    node is contained in exactly one candidate partition. 6. Coalesces adjacent optimal candidates which ended up on the same target. 7. Rewrites the model according to the chosen optimal partitioning.As for the existing partition_for_<external codegen name> methods, the result ofCollagePartition can then be built using regular TVM.Very special thanks to @mbaret for authoring test_pass_collage_partition.py.Logic to prune the candidates after step 3 will be in a follow up PR since itdeserves its own testing. A demonstration driver will also come as a follow up.* - lints* - more lints* - use the _ffi_api properly	1

Support glob syntax in ``.airflowignore`` files (#21392) (#22051)A new configuration parameter "CORE_IGNORE_FILE_SYNTAX" is added toallow patterns in .airflowignore files to be interpreted as eitherregular expressions (the default) or glob expressions as found in.gitignore files. This allows users to use patterns they will befamiliar with from tools such as git, helm and docker.Glob expressions support wildcard matches ("*", "?") within a directoryas well as character classes ("[0-9]"). In addition, zero or moredirectories can be matched using "**". Patterns can be negated byprefixing a "!" at the beginning of the pattern.The "fnmatch" library in core Python does not produce patterns that arefully compliant with the kind of patterns that users will be used tofrom gitignore or dockerignore files, so the globs are parsed usingthe pathspec package from PyPI.To aid with debugging ignorefile patterns a more helpful errormessage is emitted in the logs for invalid patterns, which arenow skipped rather than causing a hard-to-read scheduler stack trace.closes: #21392	1

KAFKA-6058: Refactor consumer API result return types (#4856)Refactored the return types in consumer group APIs the following way:```Map<TopicPartition, KafkaFuture<Void>> DeleteConsumerGroupsResult#deletedGroups()Map<TopicPartition, KafkaFuture<ConsumerGroupDescription>> DescribeConsumerGroupsResult#describedGroups()KafkaFuture<Collection<ConsumerGroupListing>> ListConsumerGroupsResult#listings()KafkaFuture<Map<TopicPartition, OffsetAndMetadata>> ListConsumerGroupOffsetsResult#partitionsToOffsetAndMetadata()```* For DeleteConsumerGroupsResult and DescribeConsumerGroupsResult, for each group id we have two round-trips to get the coordinator, and then send the delete / describe request; I leave the potential optimization of batching requests for future work.* For ListConsumerGroupOffsetsResult, it is a simple single round-trip and hence the whole map is wrapped as a Future.* ListConsumerGroupsResult, it is the most tricky one: we would only know how many futures we should wait for after the first listNode returns, and hence I constructed the flattened future in the middle wrapped with the underlying map of futures; also added an iterator API to compensate the "fail the whole future if any broker returns error" behavior. The iterator future will throw exception on the failing brokers, while return the consumer for other succeeded brokers.Reviewers: Colin Patrick McCabe <colin@cmccabe.xyz>, Jason Gustafson <jason@confluent.io>	5

gitlab-ci: native (MSYS2) Win32 32/64 builds only on schedules.Having them at each commit is counter-productive, first because thesebuilds take so long and second because there seems to be quite fewWindows runners. So we end up constantly waiting for CI jobs fromprevious commits (so we are just constantly waiting).This is resource over-usage. So instead, I'll just set this in scheduledjobs. For release preparation though, we'll have to set up a workflowlater to trigger these jobs off-schedule/on-demand (I can see there is aGitlab interface to do this), but this can wait for when the installeris fully generated by the CI anyway.	1

KAFKA-10471 Mark broker crash during log loading as unclean shutdown (#9364)LogManager writes a clean shutdown file when the broker shuts down. Thepresence of this file indicates that the broker had a clean shutdown andlog recovery is not needed upon the next boot up.Earlier, LogManager would check for this file at the start of log loading workflow,and delete it after the log has been loaded. If the broker were to crashwhile loading logs, the file would not be deleted and mislead LogManager when ittries to load logs upon next boot up. Hence, a crash during log loadingwill not be considered a hard reset of broker.As part of this fix, we delete the clean shutdown file as soon as welook it up, at the start of log loading workflow. Thereafter, we maintain a booleanflag to indicate if broker underwent clean shutdown or not. So, if thebroker were to crash while logs are being loaded, LogManager will beable to detect this as a hard reset.Reviewers: Jun Rao <junrao@gmail.com>	1

[µTVM] Avoid listing links when probing serial ports (#7265)SerialTransport.open() probes automatically the device name based upon agrep regex if a device name is not provided. The code expects to find onlya single device. Currently when it probes for the available serial ports itincludes in the list the device names that are also symbolic links.Since _find_openocd_serial_port() always returns a serial number for agiven serial port (not the device name path) the available device namesare always probed when the openocd flash runner is used.It's not uncommon that device drivers create symbolic links for certainkinds of serial devices, specially those that provide a serial port plusan additional endpoint to program the device attached, like a ST-Linkinterface, etc.As a consequence the current code fails to select the correct device namewhen symbolic links exist and the openocd flash runner is used.That commit changes the probe behavior to avoid listing symbolic links whenprobing the device name for the target serial port.Signed-off-by: Gustavo Romero <gustavo.romero@linaro.org>	1

KAFKA-8792; Default ZK configuration to disable AdminServerKafka ships with default ZK configuration. With the upgrade to ZK 3.5, our defaults include running ZK's AdminServer on port 8080. This is an unfortunate default as it tends to cause conflicts.I suggest we default to disable ZK's AdminServer in the default ZK configs that we ship. Users who want to use AdminServer can enable it and set the port to something that works for them. Realistically, in most production environments, a different ZK server will be used anyway. So this is mostly to save new users who are trying Kafka on their own machine from running into accidental and frustrating port conflicts.Author: Gwen Shapira <gwen@confluent.io>Reviewers: Ismael JumaCloses #7203 from gwenshap/zk_disable_adminserver	5

Streamline Build Images workflow using new GitHub Actions features (#15944)Use `pull_request_target` event for building images, and `concurrency` toautomatically cancel old jobs for PRs.This means that:- GitHub will automatically cancel old jobs for us, so we don't have to  handle that ourselves (removes most of the use of the  cancel-workflow-action)- GitHub displays these checks directly on the PR, but it is still run  in the context of our repo, meaning it has access write to our  repo/access to secrets etc.- Since it shows up directly on the PR checks, we don't need to create the  check in the "CI" workflow to show the status of the Image Build.- We also don't need to post the comment saying _why_ it failed, as the  Build Image status will show up directly there- Since `pull_request_target` has information about the PR in the  `github.event` context, we don't need the complex mechanism to find  the "other" PR, we can do a fairly simple API request and filter by  the commit SHA to find and cancel to CI workflow job. (This removes  the final use of the cancel-workflow-action)One change I had to make here what tag we use for Docker images we buildand push up. Previously we used the "source run ID" (i.e. the id of theCI run) but with pull_request_target we don't have that anymore. Wecould use the same API mechanism we do to cancel to find the target job,but the only requirement here is for an ID that both jobs know -- theSHA of the PR branch fills that needExtra side benefits of this:- The sidebar of commits in main branch aren't "polluted" with Build  Images for PRs like they were previously.	1

MINOR: expand logging and improve error message during partition count resolution (#11364)Recently a user hit this TaskAssignmentException due to a bug in their regex that meant no topics matched the pattern subscription, which in turn meant that it was impossible to resolve the number of partitions of the downstream repartition since there was no upstream topic to get the partition count for. Debugging this was pretty difficult and ultimately came down to stepping through the code line by line, since even with TRACE logging we only got a partial picture.We should expand the logging to make sure the TRACE logging hits both conditional branches, and improve the error message with a suggestion for what to look for should someone hit this in the futureReviewers: Walker Carlson <wcarlson@confluent.io>, Guozhang Wang <guozhang@confluent.io>, Matthias J.

Bug 795814 - Error saving VERY large file.g_alloca() is not very advisable, especially when it might be used toallocate a big chunk of memory at once. It is better to allocate dynamicmemory with malloc(), or in particular with g_try_malloc() which won'tabort the program on failure.This might be slightly slower (one of the advantages of memory on thestack, though not even an absolute truth) but probably not by much, ifat all, and it's better to be safe anyway.	1

Ensure that zombie tasks for dags with errors get cleaned up (#25550)If there is a parse error in a DAG the zombie cleanup request never ran,which resulted in the TI never leaving running state and justcontinually being detected as a zombie.(Prior to AIP-45 landing, this bug/behaviour resulted in a DAG with aparse error never actually leaving the queued state.)The fix here is to _always_ make sure we run `ti.handle_failure` when weare given a request, even if we can't load the DAG. To _try_ and work aswell as we can, we try to load the serialized_dag if we can, but incases where we can't for whatever reason we also make sureTaskInstance.handle_failure is able to operate even when `self.task` isNone.	1

Adds 'Trino' provider (with lower memory footprint for tests) (#15187)While checking the test status of various CI tests we came toconclusion that Presto integration took a lot of memory (~1GB)and was the main source of failures during integration tests,especially with MySQL8. The attempt to fine-tune the memoryused turned out in the discovery, that Presto DB stoppedpublishing their Docker image (prestosql/presto) - apparentlyafter the aftermath of splitting-off Trino from Presto.Th split-off was already discussed in #14281 and it was plannedto add support for Trino (which is the more community-drivenfork of the Presto - Presto remained at Facebook Governance,where Trino is an effort continued by the original creators.You can read more about it in the announcement:https://trino.io/blog/2020/12/27/announcing-trino.html. WhilePresto continues their way under The Linux Foundation, Trinolives its own live and keeps on maintaining all artifacts andlibraries (including the image). That allowed us to updateour tests and decrease the memory footprint by around 400MB.This commit:* adds the new Trino provider* removes `presto` integration and replaces it with `trino`* the `trino` integartion image is built with 400MB less memory  requirementes and published as `apache/airflow:trino-*`* moves the integration tests from Presto to TrinoFixes: #14281	0

[AIRFLOW-2516] Fix mysql deadlocks (#6988)Deadlocks were occuring in mysql when task_instance was modifiedby two queries at the same time. One query used state as selectioncriteria and updated it in the same query where second query justupdated the state for the same table. The first query locked stateindex first and primary index afterwards, the second query lockedprimary index first and state afterwards - leading to deadlocks.This change splits the first query into two independent ones.First query makes select FOR UPDATE and selects all the taskinstances to act on (this will lock primary index only)and second updates all affected task instances.Note that performance impact for that is neglectable because thisquery is only run once every scheduler loop and the second partof it (looping through task instances) will only happen in casethere are some manually modified DagRun states - so it is onlyrun to correct some wrong states of DagRun. This should happenvery infrequently.	5

Also update the description and name of the old versionto make clear it is deprecated in favor of the new plug-in.Finally rename the new version to simply "plug-in-spyrogimp" (droppingthe "-plus" part as we should consider it as a replacement rather thanas another plug-in, which the "plus" would imply). Anyway the old onewas called "script-fu-spyrogimp", so there is no name clash.While at it, do some trailing whitespace cleaning in the new plug-in.(cherry picked from commit 8729f9a6620d7e8a2c1666446cf0194be6b83709)	1
KAFKA-10847: improve throughput of stream-stream join with spurious left/outer join fix (#10917)The fix to avoid spurious left/outer stream-stream join results, showedvery low throughput for RocksDB, due to excessive creation of iterators.Instead of trying to emit left/outer stream-stream join result for everyinput record, this PR adds tracking of the lower timestamp bound ofleft/outer join candidates, and only tries to emit them (and create aniterator) if they are potentially old enough.Reviewers: Luke Chen <showuon@gmail.com>, Guozhang Wang <guozhang@confluent.io>, Sergio Peña <sergio@confluent.io>	5

Improve production image iteration speed (#9162)For a long time the way how entrypoint worked in ci scriptswas wrong. The way it worked was convoluted and short of blackmagic. This did not allow to pass multiple test targets andrequired separate execute command scripts in Breeze.This is all now straightened out and both production andCI image are always using the right entrypoint by defaultand we can simply pass parameters to the image as usual withoutescaping strings.This also allowed to remove some breeze commands andchange names of several flags in Breeze to make them moremeaningful.Both CI and PROD image have now embedded scripts for logcleaning.History of image releases is added for 1.10.10-*alpha quality images.	1

devel-docs: fix automake when --disable-gtk-docs is usedA number of autmake files under devel-docs expand "CLEANFILES += ...". Thisdepends on gtkdocize setting up gtk-docs.make with (amongst other things)"CLEANFILES = ...". However when running autogen.sh with --disable-gtk-docs,gtk-docs.make is only populated with EXTRA_DIST - meaning CLEANFILES is notset, and automake fails to parse the devel-docs automake files.Therefore we need to explicitly set CLEANFILES when --disable-gtk-docs isused to avoid seeing errors such as the following when running autogen:  devel-docs/libgimp/Makefile.am:85: error: CLEANFILES must be set with '=' before using '+='The CLEANFILES extension was first added in:  0052803313 (devel-docs: REVERT THIS once module.actions get removed automatically, 2020-10-25)	4

MINOR; Preserve ThrottlingQuotaExceededException when request timeouts after being retried due to a quota violation (KIP-599) (#9344)This PR adds the logic to preserve the ThrottlingQuotaExceededException when topics are retried. The throttleTimeMs is also adjusted accordingly as the request could remain pending or in-flight for quite a long time.Have run various tests on clusters with enabled quotas and I, indeed, find it better to preserve the exception. Otherwise, the caller does not really understand what is going on. This allows the caller to take the appropriate measure and also to take the throttleTimeMs into consideration.Reviewers: Rajini Sivaram <rajinisivaram@googlemail.com>	5

[FLINK-13226][connector/kafka] Fix deadlock between producer closure and transaction commit in the universal Kafka connector.This patch fixes a race condition between the checkpointing thread and main thread.The sequence causing the deadlock is the following:    1. In FlinkKafkaProducer, the main thread encounters a problem and closes all the producer       to start failover.    2. The previous checkpoint has completed, so the checkpointing thread grabs the checkpoint       lock and tries to commit the transaction on the producer that has been closed in step 1.       This commit will never succeed due to KAFKA-6635. So the checkpoint thread blocks forever.    3. In StreamTask, the main thread will eventually try to release all the record writer.       To do that, it attempts to grab the checkpoint lock which is hold by checkpoint thread in       step 2 and will never be released. So the main thread also blocks forever.KAFKA-6635 has been fixed in Kafka 2.3.0. But Flink 1.9 does not rely on that yet, So we are justgoing to fix on the Flink side first. The solution is to make sure that in FlinkKafkaProducer anyoperation relying on the underlying sender thread to finish throws an exception if the produceris closed.	5

Another important property for all layer modes implementedbelow is that compositing onto complete transparency gives thesame result as if the layer would have been in Normal blendingmode.The status of the new layer mode implementations compared to thelegacy implementations is as follows:Completely works the same: o BehindWorks the same for 100% opaque layers: o Multiply o Screen o Difference o Darken o Lighten o Dodge o Burn o Hard Light o Subtract o DivideWorks different but similar: o OverlayWork in progress: o Soft Lightsvn path=/trunk/; revision=27409	1

Issue #7539: Opening some images lock GIMP.In some conditions, and only with some installations, the called GDBends up hanging and never returning. Worse, even if you use non-blockingfunctions such as poll() or select() with a timeout, in order to waitfor the debugger output, these block anyway and never return.We are currently unsure what exactly causes such problem, but not usingthe thread command in gdb avoids it for now.This is a bit of a regression, though most of the time anyway the usefultraces are the main thread ones (I think ever since I implemented this,there must not have been more than 2 or 3 cases where we actually neededthe secondary traces). So it's acceptable, at least for now.	1

Rename `xcom.dagrun_id` to `xcom.dag_run_id` (#21806)We use snake case for tables and columns in the metadata database.  So references (in the database) to `dag_run.id` should be `dag_run_id`.  Historically though, in many places in the codebase we used the expression "dag run id" to refer to the `run_id` attribtue of the DagRun model.  So here we try to disambiguate this where necessary by using `run_id` to refer to DagRun.run_id and `dag_run_id` to refer to `DagRun.id`.One area where I did not make any changes is in the REST API which exposes parameter `dag_run_id` to refer to the `run_id` field in DagRun.  Since this param is user-facing, it's OK for it to be disconnected from the internal code references and certainly from database object naming.  We can consider renaming to `run_id` in the next major API release.  Also did not change the code in `views.py`.Squashed commits:* rename IN_MEMORY_DAGRUN_ID* rename ARG_EXECUTION_DATE_OR_RUN_ID* rename DagrunIdDep* fake_dagrun_id* rename dagrun_id to dag_run_id* clarify docstrings / comments* rename dag_run_id to run_id in dag model* _set_dag_run_state param dag_run_id -> run_id	1

Bug 684429 - Unable to edit text: error message states "problems..."This fix is entirely sick, so is our method of serializing units,which we write out as (unit foo bar) instead of (unit "foo bar"). Theassumption that caused this shit was that a unit's "identifier" isreally an identifier in the C-ish sense, when in fact it's just arandom user entered string.Here, we try to parse at least the default units shipped with gimp,and we add code to parse (unit "foo bar") in order to be compatiblewith future correct unit serializing.	1

libgimpconfig: Prevent GIR conflicts in GimpConfigWriterGimpConfigWriter contains several constructors with the convention`gimp_config_writer_new_* ()`.

[JIT] Force finalization of JITed code, expose sf/hf runtime functions (#12187)* [JIT] Force finalization of JITed code, expose sf/hf runtime functionsCode that handles fp16 and fp32 may end up calling builtins that do theconversions between these types. LLVM emits calls to __truncsfhf2, and__extendhfsf2, which are not present in TVM or TVM runtime. This createstwo problems:- Problem 1: JITed code that does the conversions will fail because it  calls non-existent functions.Adding these functions to libtvm.so/libtvm_runtime.so solves this part,but there is another issue:- Problem 2: JITed code may still not call these functions, because thegenerated object may not be fully resolved.To force full resolution, try to obtain an address of a non-existentsymbol.* Restart CI	1

plug-ins: port file-jpeg export procedure to new API.This is nearly 600 lines less for basically the same logics! Removedcode is in particular all the GUI code is favor of the new GUIgeneration.I also cleaned a lot of stuff, removing many global variables or uglypieces of code. I also removed a lot of redundant code of things whichare now generic, such as handling of "gimp-comment" parasite (this isnow handled by GimpSaveProcedure and GimpImageMetadata) as well assaving previous run's values (this is also handled generically).Note that Advanced Options used to be in an expander. For now I chose toget them immediately visible (still in their own "Advanced Options"section, but it's now a normal frame, not an expander hidden by default)since lately we got some input that many "advanced options" in variousdialogs should not be hidden away. So let's try like this for now (eventhough it packs quite a lot of options in the same dialog!).I thoroughly tested, yet that were so many changes that bugs may havesneaked in. Please anyone, test JPEG export!	3

Even referencedocuments display the 3 versions in the same documents! I just went witha 2-letter version with degree, as seen on Wikipedia, and to alignbetter with other 2-letter LCh values. That's pretty arbitrary and canbe changed if another shortened name is considered better.	1

KAFKA-7415; Persist leader epoch and start offset on becoming a leader (#5678)This patch ensures that the leader epoch cache is updated when a broker becomes leader with the latest epoch and the log end offset as its starting offset. This guarantees that the leader will be able to provide the right truncation point even if the follower has data from leader epochs which the leader itself does not have. This situation can occur when there are back to back leader elections.Additionally, we have made the following changes:1. The leader epoch cache enforces monotonically increase epochs and starting offsets among its entry. Whenever a new entry is appended which violates requirement, we remove the conflicting entries from the cache.2. Previously we returned an unknown epoch and offset if an epoch is queried which comes before the first entry in the cache. Now we return the smallest . For example, if the earliest entry in the cache is (epoch=5, startOffset=10), then a query for epoch 4 will return (epoch=4, endOffset=10). This ensures that followers (and consumers in KIP-320) can always determine where the correct starting point is for the active log range on the leader.Reviewers: Jun Rao <junrao@gmail.com>	2

[FLINK-21490][tests] Harden UnalignedCheckpointITCase.The source readers currently inferred the number of checkpoints individually potentially causing a drift. Number of checkpoint and restarts is now calculated in the coordinator and propagated to the readers keeping them in sync. The mechanism to infer the number of restarts has been improved by directly notifying enumerator when a source reader is created (RuntimeContext is unavailable in source).Further, if the payload of the test passes MAX_INT, then checkHeader fails as it uses the upper 4 bytes of the long to check for magic bytes. A checkstate ensures that no overflow happens and aborts the test with a meaningful message. checkHeader further prints the expected and actual value.This commit includes some refactorings for the upcoming UnalignedCheckpointRescaleITCase which eases the maintenance of the test in 1.12 and master branch.	3

The facility to specify the background colour of a transparent/animatedTue Sep 15 21:27:10 BST 1998  Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>* plug-ins/gif.c:The facility to specify the background colour ofa transparent/animated GIF for non-transparentviewers now works very much more consistantly.The only situations in which it will fail to workas expected now are those where file size can be reduced(abeit not by much, as the plugin is sometimes more pessimisticthan it need be) by re-using an existing unused colourindex rather than using another bit per pixel in theencoded file.  That will never be an issue with an imagewhich was freshly converted from RGB to INDEXED with theQuantize option, as that option removes any unused coloursfrom the image.Let me know if you find the consistancy/size tradeoff moreannoying than helpful and I can adjust it.  IMHO it is tooarcane a feature to present to any user as a runtime option.* app/ink.c: #include <string.h> for a memset	1

It also adds the call togimp_tool_control_halt() which is most likely right anyway since we arehalting the tool. This also makes the code consistent and any futurechanges to HALT case will be directly enabled after COMMIT.	0

[AIRFLOW-565] Fixes DockerOperator on Python3.xThe issue is that `self.cli.pull()` returns`bytes()`, and not a string. Then,when we try to pass that to `json.loads()`, itraises an exception.The fix is to convert the bytes to a string bydecoding it as "utf-8". We'rehardcoding the encoding because, by the JSONschema, a JSON should encoded inUTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32. Considering we're onlypulling images from Dockerservers, we can be relatively safe that they'llbehave correctly.Closes #1832 from vitorbaptista/bug/fixes-AIRFLOW-565	0

app: Keep track of GimpImage export dirtinessSince save and export are separate activities we need to keep track ofimage dirtiness for both of them. For this purpose, add a'export_dirty' member to GimpImage which has the same semantics as'dirty', but for export. Set it to clean whenever a document isexported by whatever means. Do this with a new functiongimp_image_export_clean_all(). Also add gimp_image_is_export_dirty().	1

Enable pushing early image cache to ghcr.io registry (#26119)In order to react quicker to changes in setup.py, setup.cfg andDockerfiles, we can push an early image cache to the ghcr.io cache.This build is done way before constraints are regenerated so it isusing the "current" constraints at the moment the merge happens.This should be safe - if the image fails to build (we ignore that)the cache will not be pushed, but if it will, then even if we mergea new commit quickly and the rest of the build is cancelled, thecache will be refreshed with new Dockerfile/setup.py/setup.cfg andthe subsequent builds will run much faster.	1

app: support saving/exporting with multi-selection.This commit just changes our saving API (i.e. the GimpSaveProcedureclass) to take an array of drawables as argument instead of a singledrawable.It actually doesn't matter much for exporting as the whole API seemsmore or less bogus there and all formats plug-ins mostly care onlywhether they will merge/flatten all visible layers (the selected onesdon't really matter) or if the format supports layers of some sort. Itmay be worth later strengthening a bit this whole logics, and maybeallow partial exports for instance.As for saving, it was not even looking at the passed GimpDrawable eitherand was simply re-querying the active layer anyway.Note that I don't implement the multi-selection saving in XCF yet inthis commit. I only updated the API. The reason is that the currentcommit won't be backportable to gimp-2-10 because it is an API break. Onthe other hand, the code to save multi-selection can still be backportedeven though the save() API will only pass a single drawable (as I saidanyway, this argument was mostly bogus until now, hence it doesn'tmatter much for 2.10 logics).	2

[FLINK-24035][network] Guarantee that the LocalBufferPool is initialized with one bufferPreviously, The buffer listeners are not notified when the the local buffer pool receives available notification from the global pool. This may cause potential deadlock issue:1. A LocalBufferPool is created but there is no available buffers in the global NetworkBufferPool.2. The LocalBufferPool registers an available buffer listener to the global NetworkBufferPool.3. The BufferManager requests buffers from the LocalBufferPool but no buffer is available. As a result, it registers an available buffer listener to the LocalBufferPool.4. A buffer is recycled to the global NetworkBufferPool and the LocalBufferPool is notified about the available buffer.5. The LocalBufferPool requests the available buffer from the global NetworkBufferPool but the registered available buffer listener of BufferManager is not notified and it can never get a chance to be notified so deadlock occurs.This patch fixes this issue by guaranteeing that the LocalBufferPool is initialized with one buffer. With this piece of guaranteed buffer, the LocalBufferPool will be in the healthy buffer request and recycle loop. Note: We are not fixing this issue by notifying the buffer listeners when the local buffer pool receives available notification from the global pool because of the potential deadlock.	1

First, we were not shutting down the timer services in `RaftManager` which are used in the purgatory implementation. This meant that operations remaining in purgatory could be completed even after `RaftManager` was shutdown. Second, the shutdown order in `KafkaClusterTestKit` was problematic. The `RaftManager` instance depends on the `SocketServer` in `ControllerServer`, but it was the latter that was shutdown first. Instead, we should shutdown `RaftManager` first as we do in `KafkaRaftServer`. Reviewers: Ismael Juma <ismael@juma.me.uk>	0

app, libgimp: don't close parent pipes in libgimp; use gimp_spawn_set_cloexec()In gimp_plug_in_open(), use gimp_spawn_set_cloexec() to prevent theparent's end of the read/write pipes from being inherited by thespawned plug-in, instead of passing the corresponding filedescriptors to the plug-in as command-line arguments, and havinggimp_main() close them.Adding new command-line arguments to plug-ins is problematic, sincetheir ability to handle them depends on their protocol version,which is only communicated after the plug-in is spawned.Regardless, this is much simpler.	0

KAFKA-6819: Pt. 1 - Refactor thread-level Streams metrics (#6631)* StreamsMetricsImpl wraps the Kafka Streams' metrics registry and provides logic to createand register sensors and their corresponding metrics. An example for such logic can be found inthreadLevelSensor(). Furthermore, StreamsMetricsmpl keeps track of the sensors on thedifferent levels of an application, i.e., thread, task, etc., and provides logic to remove sensors perlevel, e.g., removeAllThreadLevelSensors(). There is one StreamsMetricsImpl object perapplication instance.* ThreadMetrics contains only static methods that specify all built-in thread-level sensors andmetrics and provide logic to register and retrieve those thread-level sensors, e.g., commitSensor().* From anywhere inside the code base with access to StreamsMetricsImpl, thread-level sensors can be accessed by using ThreadMetrics.* ThreadsMetrics does not inherit from StreamsMetricsImpl anymore.Reviewers: A.

KAFKA-2593: Key value stores can use specified serializers and deserializersAdd support for the key value stores to use specified serializers and deserializers (aka, "serdes"). Prior to this change, the stores were limited to only the default serdes specified in the topology's configuration and exposed to the processors via the ProcessorContext.Now, using InMemoryKeyValueStore and RocksDBKeyValueStore are similar: both are parameterized on the key and value types, and both have similar multiple static factory methods. The static factory methods either take explicit key and value serdes, take key and value class types so the serdes can be inferred (only for the built-in serdes for string, integer, long, and byte array types), or use the default serdes on the ProcessorContext.Author: Randall Hauch <rhauch@gmail.com>Reviewers: Guozhang WangCloses #255 from rhauch/kafka-2593	1

libgimpbase, libgimp, app: pass icon theme dir to plug-ins through configPass the current icon theme directory to plug-ins through theconfig message, and add a gimp_icon_theme_dir() libgimp functionfor retrieving it.  Note that we already have a similargimp_icon_get_theme_dir() PDB function, which we keep around, sinceit can be used to dynamically query for the current icon dir,unlike the former, and since it returns a dynamically-allocatedstring, while the rest of the config-related functions returnstatically allocated strings.Use the new function, instead of gimp_get_icon_theme_dir(), ingimp_ui_init().  This allows gimp_ui_init() to run without makingany PDB calls.  Consequently, this allows us to start plug-ins thatcall gimp_ui_init() without entering the main loop in the main app.We're going to add a plug-in that displays an interactive dialogwhile the main app is blocking waiting for an operation tocomplete, and we need to be able to start the plug-in withoutentering the main loop, to avoid the possibility of arbitrary codebeing executed during the wait.Bump the protocol version.	2

KAFKA-12153; Update producer state before updating start/end offsets after truncation (#9838)When we truncate the log, the first unstable offset might become valid. On the other hand, the logic in `updateHighWatermarkMetadata` assumes that the first stable offset remains at a valid position. Since this method can be reached through either `updateLogStartOffset` or `updateLogEndOffset` in the truncation paths, we need to ensure that the first unstable offset first reflects the truncated state.Reviewers: Chia-Ping Tsai <chia7712@gmail.com>, Jun Rao <junrao@gmail.com>	1

app: add an info label above GimpItemTreeView item list to indicate…… multi-selected items.The idea is that with multi-selection now enabled, you may always losetrack and forget you have several items/layers selected. This isespecially true when you have a lot of layers (say you selected one atthe top of the list, another at the bottom; without scrolling, you mayonly see one of them). And this can become bad when doing somedestructive action which is allowed on several layers at once (saydeleting several layers while you thought you were deleting only one!).I got the idea from Thunderbird GUI which also displays the number ofselected conversations in the email list. Same as in Thunderbird, I alsowanted to theme the label similarly to a selected item in the item listbelow. This was hard because there is no way to reference the parenttheme colors from within GIMP one. Instead I made so that the label isalways shown as a fully selected text (which is a bit ugly semantically,but I could not find better). Why I wanted this styling is to give *abit* of focus to this info so that it is not too invisible. Otherwisepurpose is defeated. Yet this label is still more subtle thanThunderbird one (don't want to take all attention toward it). Hopefullythis got the right in-between style.	5

We observe multiple groups across a range of domains (ASR, NMT, LM, etc), (#3566)internally and externally, interested in replacing standard dense layers withblock-sparse matrix multiplication layers. The motivations are generally: higherperformance (due to reduction in FLOPs, memory bandwidth/cache footprint),enabling larger models (e.g. fitting more layers in a given memory budget).Some public work along these lines:* https://openai.com/blog/block-sparse-gpu-kernels/* https://openai.com/blog/sparse-transformer/* https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08435* https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02782Various groups have been able to successfully train models with reasonablelevels of sparsity (90%+) with marginal accuracy changes, which suggestssubstantial speedups are possible (as this implies a >10x reduction in FLOPs).It is fairly straightforward to realize these theoretical speedups, see e.g. TVMbenchmarks for Intel CPUs inhttps://gist.github.com/ajtulloch/e65f90487bceb8848128e8db582fe902, and CUDAresults in https://github.com/openai/blocksparse, etc.* https://github.com/openai/blocksparse (CUDA)* https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl-developer-reference-c-mkl-bsrmm (MKL BSRM)* https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.bsr_matrix.html (SCIPY BSR representation)This is extracted from an internal patch we've been using internally. There arevarious extensions possible (int8/fp16/bf16, CUDA/other GPU architectures), butthis is a reasonable starting point. This needs more thorough unit test coveragehowever.We follow the conventions established by scipy.sparse.bsr_matrix and otherlibraries, see the unit tests for details.For folks interested in experimenting with scheduling/AutoTVM etc,https://gist.github.com/ajtulloch/e65f90487bceb8848128e8db582fe902 is a usefulstarting point.	1

MINOR: Update to Gradle 6.5 and tweak build jvm config (#8751)Gradle 6.5 includes a fix for https://github.com/gradle/gradle/pull/12866, whichaffects the performance of Scala compilation.I profiled the scalac build with async profiler and 54% of the time was on GCeven after the Gradle upgrade (it was more than 60% before), so I switched tothe throughput GC (GC latency is less important for batch builds) and itwas reduced to 38%.I also centralized the jvm configuration in `build.gradle` and simplified it a bitby removing the minHeapSize configuration from the test tasks.On my desktop, the time to execute clean builds with no cached Gradle daemonwas reduced from 127 seconds to 97 seconds. With a cached daemon, it wasreduced from 120 seconds to 88 seconds. The performance regression whenwe upgraded to Gradle 6.x was 27 seconds with a cached daemon (https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/7677#issuecomment-616271179), so itshould be fixed now.Gradle 6.4 with no cached daemon:```BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2m 7s115 actionable tasks: 112 executed, 3 up-to-date./gradlew clean compileScala compileJava compileTestScala compileTestJava  1.15s user 0.12s system 0% cpu 2:08.06 total```Gradle 6.4 with cached daemon:```BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2m 0s115 actionable tasks: 111 executed, 4 up-to-date./gradlew clean compileScala compileJava compileTestScala compileTestJava  0.95s user 0.10s system 0% cpu 2:01.42 total```Gradle 6.5 with no cached daemon:```BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1m 46s115 actionable tasks: 111 executed, 4 up-to-date./gradlew clean compileScala compileJava compileTestScala compileTestJava  1.27s user 0.12s system 1% cpu 1:47.71 total```Gradle 6.5 with cached daemon:```BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1m 37s115 actionable tasks: 111 executed, 4 up-to-date./gradlew clean compileScala compileJava compileTestScala compileTestJava  1.02s user 0.10s system 1% cpu 1:38.31 total```This PR with no cached Gradle daemon:```BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1m 37s115 actionable tasks: 81 executed, 34 up-to-date./gradlew clean compileScala compileJava compileTestScala compileTestJava  1.27s user 0.10s system 1% cpu 1:38.70 total```This PR with cached Gradle daemon:```BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1m 28s115 actionable tasks: 111 executed, 4 up-to-date./gradlew clean compileScala compileJava compileTestScala compileTestJava  1.02s user 0.10s system 1% cpu 1:29.35 total```Reviewers: Manikumar Reddy <manikumar.reddy@gmail.com>, Chia-Ping Tsai <chia7712@gmail.com>	5

Prevent race condition in trying to collect result from DagFileProcessor (#11306)A rare race condition was noticed in the Scheduler HA PR where the"test_dags_with_system_exit" test would occasionally fail with thefollowing symptoms:- The pipe was "readable" as returned by  `multiprocessing.connection.wait`- On reading it yielded an EOFError, meaning the other side had closed  the connection- But the process was still alive/runningThis previously would result in the Manager process dying with an error.This PR makes a few changes:- It ensures that the pipe is simplex, not duplex (we only ever send one  data) as this is simpler- We ensure that the "other" end of the pipe is correctly closed in both  parent and child processes. Without this the pipe would be kept open  (sometimes) until the child process had closed anyway.- When we get an EOFError on reading and the process is still alive, we  give it a few seconds to shut down cleanly, and then kill it.	4

Ingimp_drawable_real_set_buffer(), set the item size according to therect dimensions, instead of the buffer dimensions.  The rect'swidth/height may be 0, in which case the buffer's dimensions areused.Adapt the rest of the code.We do this in preparation for maintaining the drawable's boundingbox separately from its logical bounds, allowing the drawablecontent to extend beyond its bounds.	1

Merge-friendly output of command hashes for breeze (#24711)We had just one hash generated from all commands in breeze and thatbasically meant that when there were two PRs on two differentcommands in Breeze, they resulted with merge conflict whichshould be solved with `breeze regenerate-command-images`.This change turns the hash output into a multi-command one - i.e.each command has its own hash, which will make it much moremerge-friendly - i.e. if two PRs will work on two different commandsthe rebase should result with merge rather than conflict.	5

KAFKA-12998: Implement broker-side KRaft snapshots (#10931)This PR implements broker-side KRaft snapshots, including both saving andloading. The code for triggering a periodic broker-side snapshot will come in afollow-on PR. Loading should work with just this PR. It also implementsreloading broker snapshots after initialization.In order to facilitate snapshots, this PR introduces the concept ofMetadataImage and MetadataDelta. MetadataImage represents the metadata stateretained in memory. It is basically a generalization of MetadataCache thatincludes a few things that MetadataCache does not (such as features and clientquotas.) KRaftMetadataCache is now an accessor for the data stored in this object.Similarly, MetadataImage replaces CacheConfigRespository and ClientQuotaCache.It also subsumes kafka.server.metadata.MetadataImage and related classes.MetadataDelta represents a change to a MetadataImage. When a KRaft snapshot isloaded, we will accumulate all the changes into a MetadataDelta first, prior toapplying it. If we must reload a snapshot because we fell too far behind whileconsuming metadata, the resulting MetadataDelta will contain all the changesneeded to catch us up. During normal operation, MetadataDelta is also used toaccumulate the changes of each incoming batch of metadata records. Theseincremental deltas should be relatively small.I have removed the logic for updating the various manager objects fromBrokerMetadataListener and placed it into BrokerMetadataPublisher. This makesit easier to unit test BrokerMetadataListener.Reviewers: David Arthur <mumrah@gmail.com>, Jason Gustafson <jason@confluent.io>	5

Clean up command-line arguments (#11682)* Clean up command-line arguments- The `--do-pickle` argument is exclusively used by the scheduler, the `worker` command completely ignores it.- Remove the `ARG_DAG_ID_OPT` entry entirely. The scheduler doesn't take a `--dag-id` option, and while the `dags list-runs` and `dags list-jobs` commands *do* take such a switch, the help text here is incorrect, they simply need to use `ARG_DAG_ID`.* Put ARG_DAG_ID_OPT backIt differs from ARG_DAG_ID in that it is an optional command-line switch. I changed the help text to match its use: to select a specific DAG when listing runs or jobs. The dag is not actually triggered.	2

libgimpconfig: fix gimp_config_param_spec_duplicate() for objects and…… object arrays.We were not supporting duplicating object pspec for no good reason. Wellmaybe the reason was that libgimpconfig does not see these types whichare in libgimp. But then the trick is to compare by name.As for object array, they are present as subtypes of GimpArray specs.Yet most GimpParamSpec*Array-s are subclass of GimpParamSpecArray butGimpParamSpecObjectArray are their own GParamSpecBoxed subclass (same asthe Gimp*Array-s are just typedef-s of GimpArray but GimpObjectArray isits own boxed type).So I had to move the object array test as its own case to fix support.Finally do not ignore anymore any type in gimp_config_class_init(). Whenwe create a GimpConfig, we want to know when a type is not implementedas parameter (and if it's a well known type, we need to implement it).	2
