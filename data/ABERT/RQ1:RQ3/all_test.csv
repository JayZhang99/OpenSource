"[Relay] Refactor Interpreter to treat lowering as IRModule->IRModule rewrite. (#8597)* This continues the work outlined in the RFC  https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-relay-tecompiler-rewrite-existing-compile-engine-to-match-updated-compiler-flow/9233This gets about halfway there for the Interpreter:* Remove direct access to TECompiler from interpreter, and instead call  tec::LowerTEExpr when 'preparing' a module and expression for evaluation.* Make clear there's no phase distinction between create_interpreter and  evaluate on the Python side -- both must be prepared together as a single IRModule.* But in return make sure the result of evaluate on the Python side is a packed func  ready to directly apply 'simple' arguments to an already interpreted closure.* The interpreter builds and caches primitive TIR functions (and their corresponding  dynamic shape functions) as packed funcs as they are encountered.* Cleanup uses of interpreter for constant folding on the C++ side.Future work:* Fold LoweredModule into IRModule so tec::LowerTEExpr is just another pass.* Get rid of the implicit caching of lowered functions in TECompiler.* Make calling convention from Relay to TIR explicit, and remove all the function  attribute hackery currently needed so the interpreter can correctly invoke lowered  functions as it encounters them.* Make TECompiler private. Though could do this now it will make migrating the VM and  AOT uses of CompilerEngine harder.Force a gc between sphinx-gallery items to reclaim GPU memory. (#8722)GPU memory is only released once the PackedFunc for evaling the model is gcedby Python. In CI we're noticing intermittent 'CUDA: Out of memory' failureswhile processing the tutorials, and tracing showed there was no gc happeningbetween items. Not confident this will solve the problem but worth a try.* Get rid of logs spam.",2

When that change was made, the existingassume role code was removed, leaving only ID/Secret credentials as anoption.  Our dags rely on role assumption to access external S3 buckets, sothis code re-adds role assumption via STS.Additionally, in order to make this a bit easier,I changed _get_credentials to return a functioning boto3 session which is usedby the public methods to initialize clients/resources/whatever.

They are currently only used by deferral, but have been written to be independent in case they are useful elsewhere.- Two new dependencies are added  - `jump-consistent-hash` is a small MIT licensed library that implements a fast, consistent hash algorithm  - `pytest-asyncio` is an Apache 2 licensed library that enables async tests to be written easilyChanges that are deliberately not in here and will be in a future PR for them specifically: - UI warning when the triggerer is not running and you have deferred task instances - Updating Breeze to include `triggerer` in what it runs - Updating the Docker Compose files to include `triggerer` - Updating the Helm Chart to include `triggerer` - Some way of detecting/preventing DB access within triggers",5

"KAFKA-10240: Suppress WakeupExceptions during sink task shutdown (#9003)A benign `WakeupException` can be thrown by a sink task's consumer if the task is scheduled for shutdown by the worker. This is caught and handled gracefully if the exception is thrown when calling `poll` on the consumer, but not if calling `commitSync`, which is invoked by a task during shutdown and also when its partition assignment is updated.If thrown during a partition assignment update, the `WakeupException` is caught and handled gracefully as part of the task's `iteration` loop. If thrown during shutdown, however, it is not caught and instead leads to the misleading log message ""Task threw an uncaught and unrecoverable exception. Task is being killed and will not recover until manually restarted."".These changes catch the `WakeupException` during shutdown and handle it gracefully with a `TRACE`-level log message.A unit test is added to verify this behavior by simulating a thrown `WakeupException` during `Consumer::commitSync`, running through the `WorkerSinkTask::execute` method, and confirming that it does not throw a `WakeupException` itself.Reviewers: Greg Harris <gregh@confluent.io>, Nigel Liang <nigel@nigelliang.com>, Konstantine Karantasis <k.karantasis@gmail.com>",5

"MINOR: Remove copyDependantTestLibs from jar dependencies_copyDependantTestLibs_ was added temporarily as a dependency of _jar_ task to enable SASL system tests to be run with MiniKdc without changing the automated system test runs which run _gradlew clean jar_.

"Added k9s as integrated tool to help with kubernetes testing (#12163)The K9s is fantastic tool that helps to debug a running k8sinstance. It is terminal-based windowed CLI that makes youseveral times more productive comparing to using kubectlcommands. We've integrated k9s (it is run as a docker containerand downloaded on demand). We've also separated out KUBECONFIGof the integrated kind cluster so that it does not mess withkubernetes configuration you might already have.Also - together with that the ""surrounding"" of the kubernetestests were simplified and improved so that the k9s integrationcan be utilized well. Instead of kubectl port forwarding (whichcaused multitude of problems) we are now utilizing kind'sportMapping feature + custom NodePort resource that mapsport 8080 to 30007 NodePort which in turn maps it to 8080port of the Webserver. This way we do not have to establishan external kubectl port forward which is prone to error andmanagement - everything is brought up when Airflow getsdeployed to the Kind Cluster and shuts down when the Kindcluster is stopped.Yet another problem fixed was killing of postgres by one of thekubernetes tests ('test_integration_run_dag_with_scheduler_failure').Instead of just killing the scheduler it killed all pods - includingthe Postgres one (it was named 'airflow-postgres.*'). That causedvarious problems, as the database could be left in a strange state.I changed the tests to do what it claimed was doing - so killing only thescheduler during the test.

"libgimpbase: do not assume PATH_MAX to be the actual max size of paths.Even though it is set by Linux's limits.h and apparently by other OSestoo, it seems this macro is mostly bogus. On many systems, the actualallowed max size of paths is much higher.On Hurd, they don't even define the macro as there is no upper limit.See MR !424.This commit replaces two usages of PATH_MAX:- readlink() by g_file_read_link(). I checked the GLib implementation  and could confirm it will do the proper thing, which is progressively  incrementing their buffer allocation in a loop until the buffer is big  enough to contain the symbolic link contents. Hence no need to rely on  a bogus macro which is not the actual max.- fgets() by g_data_input_stream_read_line() which also dynamically  allocates the returned buffer, and also properly removes the newline  and adds a NUL byte (hence simpler code).Additionally I loop through the lines of /proc/self/maps until I findthe first ""r-xp"" pathname. Indeed the current code was assuming that thefirst line was always right. Yet on my OS at least, the first line wasGIMP executable with ""r--p"" permission, hence the test would fail. Thesecond line had the right permission. So let's assume that we want thefirst executable path, looping through each line.",0

"[FLINK-998] Close network connections when idle1. Close idle TCP connectionsTasks enqueue envelopes to be dispatched via NettyConnectionManager. Thefirst task to enqueue an envelope triggers the establishment of a newTCP connection to the target task manager. Usually, there are multipleconnections between the same task managers in order to avoid deadlocks.This commit addresses the following problem: idle connections were neverclosed. This meant that the number of TCP connections was monotonicallyincreasing over time. Idling connections are now closed after aconfigured amount of time, see 'taskmanager.net.closeAfterIdleForMs'.2. Enqueue envelopes directlyTCP connections are handled by Netty's IO loop. Every enqueue operationneeds to ensure that the envelope to be enqueued is handed over to therespective IO thread in a thread-safe manner. Previously, this was donevia Netty's user events.This commit addresses the following problem: every enqueue operationresulted in the creation of an IO event loop task to hand over theenvelope. Envelopes are now directly added to a ConcurrentLinkedQueue,which drastically improves the throughput of enqueue operations. Theuser event is now only fired to trigger the processing if the queue wasempty.3. Added unit tests for OutboundConnectionQueue and adapted existingtests to test concurrent enqueue and close4. Removed unused arguments to NettyConnectionManager (low and highwater mark)This closes #76.",1

"KAFKA-6936: Implicit materialized for aggregate, count and reduce (#5066)In #4919 we propagate the SerDes for each of these aggregation operators.As @guozhangwang mentioned in that PR:```reduce: inherit the key and value serdes from the parent XXImpl class.count: inherit the key serdes, enforce setting the Serdes.Long() for value serdes.aggregate: inherit the key serdes, do not set for value serdes internally.```Although it's all good for reduce and count, it is quiet unsafe to have aggregate without Materialized given. In fact I don't see why we would not give a Materialized for the aggregate since the result type will always be different (otherwise use reduce) and also the value Serde is simply not propagated.This has been discussed previously in a broader PR before but I believe for aggregate we could pass implicitly a Materialized the same way we pass a Joined, just to avoid the stupid case. Then if the user wants to specialize, he can give his own Materialized.Reviewers: Debasish Ghosh <dghosh@acm.org>, Guozhang Wang <guozhang@confluent.io>",5

It is possible that the log is truncated in between these two conditions which could cause the high watermark to be equal to the log end offset.

"KAFKA-8098: fix the flaky test by disabling the auto commit to avoid member rejoiningIn the test, we first test removing 1 member from group, and then test removing the other 2 members from group, and it failed sometimes at the 2nd member number assert. After investigation, I found it's because we enabled auto commit for the consumers(default setting), and the removed consumer offset commit will get the `UNKNOWN_MEMBER_ID` error, which will then make the member rejoin. (check ConsumerCoordinator#OffsetCommitResponseHandler) So, that's why after the 2nd members removing, the members will sometimes be not empty.I set the consumer config to disable the auto commit to fix this issue.

"app: a few async font loading fixesIn gimp_data_factory_finalize(), wait on the factory's async setafter canceling it, and before continuing destruction.  It's notgenerally safe to just abandon an async op without waiting on it-- this is a font-specific hack, due to the fact we can't actuallycancel font loading, and GimpFontFactory is prepared to handlethis.Instead, in gimp_font_factory_finalize(), cancel and clear theasync set, so that GimpDataFactory doesn't actually wait forloading to finish.In gimp_font_factory_load_async_callback(), don't try to acess thefactory when the operation is canceled, since cancelation means thefactory is already dead.  On the other hand, when the opeationisn't canceled, make sure to thaw the container even when fontloading failed, so that we always match the freeze at the beginingof the operation.",5
"[FLINK-1967] Introduce (Event)time in StreamingThis introduces an additional timestamp field in StreamRecord. When using aSourceFunction and an auto-timestamp interval is set using theExecutionConfig, the timestamp is automatically set to System.currentTimeMillis()upon element emission. The timestamp can be manually set using anEventTimeSourceFunction.This also changes the signature of the StreamOperators. They now geta StreamRecord instead of the unwrapped value. This is necessary forthem to access the timestamp. Before, the StreamTask would unwrap thevalue from the StreamRecord, now this is moved one layer higher.This also introduces watermarks to keep track of processing. Ata configurable interval the sources will emit watermarks that signifythat no records with a lower timestamp will be emitted in the future bythis source. The timestamps are broadcast, stream inputs wait for watermarkevents on all input channels and forward the watermark to theStreamOperator once the watermark advances on all inputs. Operators areresponsible for forwarding the watermark once they know that no elementswith a previous timestamp will be emitted (this is mostly relevant forbuffering operations such as windows). Right now, all operators simplyforward the watermark they receive.When using an EventTimeSourceFunction the system does notautomatically emit timestamps, the user is required to manually emitwatermarks using the SourceContext.No watermarks will be emitted unlessExecutionConfig.setAutoWatermarkInterval is used to set a watermarkinterval.Per default timestamps and watermarks are completely disabled, there isa switch in ExecutionConfig (enableTimstamps()) to enable them. Thismeans that, out-of-box, the performance is not changed by adding thisnew feature. If it is not used.This commit contains fixes for other stuff that was discovered whileimplementing the feature. See Jira issue numbers and descriptions below.[FLINK-2290/2295] Fix CoReader Event Handling and CheckpointingThis changes CoReader (now CoStreamingRecordReader) to reuseUnionGate for the input multiplexing. This way it will not lock in onone specific input side and read events from both input sides.This also enables an event listener for checkpoint barriers so that theTwoInputTask now reacts to those and correctly forwards them.Then, this adds CoStreamCheckpointintITCase to verify that checkpointingworks in topologies with TwoInputStreamTasks.This also adds tests for OneInputStreamTask and TwoInputStreamTaskthat check whether: - whether open()/close() of RichFunctions are correctly   called - Watermarks are correctly forwarded - Supersteps/checkpoint barriers are correctly forwarded and the   blocking of inputs works correctlyAdd proper tests for Stream OperatorsThese test whether: - open()/close() on RichFunctions are called - Timestamps of emitted elements match the timestamp of the input   element - Watermarks are correctly forwarded[FLINK-2301] Fix Behaviour of BarrierBuffer and add TestsBefore, a CheckpointBarrier from a more recent Checkpoint would alsotrigger unblocking while waiting on an older CheckpointBarrier. Now,a CheckpointBarrier from a newer checkpoint will unblock all channelsand start a new wait on the new Checkpoint.The tests for OneInputStreamTask and TwoInputStreamTask check whetherthe buffer behaves correctly when receiving CheckpointBarriers from morerecent checkpoints while still waiting on an older CheckpointBarrier.",3

"[FLINK-10311][tests] Test job cancellation with standby masters.This adds tests to verify that jobs can be cancelled properly when there arestandby masters. To enable this, we added tests to install Flink as astandalone cluster. The first two DB nodes will be running the masterprocesses, while the others are running the TaskManagers. All Flink processesare supervised by runit – this allows killing for Flink processes by thenemesis.The client now implements a cancel operation. The model used by the checkerhad to be rewritten to address the fact that the job can be canceled. Thecancel operation is ""reliable"", i.e., it either cancels the job successfully,or it fails the whole test fatally. This way we can be that the job shouldbe eventually not running if the cancel operation completes successfully.This closes #6712.",1

"Introduce --interface-api={c,packed} parameter (#8280)* Introduce --interface-api={c,packed} parameterThis introduces structures generated to provide a documented and stable userfriendly interface to a TVM generated model, as can be seen in the AOTdemo application:```struct tvmgen_default_inputs inputs = {  .input_1 = input_data,};struct tvmgen_default_outputs outputs = {  .output = output_data,};int ret_val = tvmgen_default_run(&inputs, &outputs, NULL, NULL);```To facilitate this, some other changes are included:* Removed dependency on `aot_executor.{c,h}` in tests, pending thediscussion in the interface RFC as to whether we keep them.* Moved creation of test DLTensor's into the AOT test utils, in future thiscan be replaced by loading via the Python API or otherwise* Introduce `parametrize_aot_options` which can be used to testpermutations of AOT which work together - for now this filters Cinterface and packed operators* Updated demo application to generate the header for demonstrationpurposes, we should consider porting the demo application to ModelLibrary Format and using the toolchain in the Zephyr App via CMakeinstead?This patch builds upon the improvements @giuseros made to AOT testingand name mangling from #8014* Tweak metadata variable description and MLF target loop* Remove direct usage of `relay::Var` in meta_data.hThis looks like the only place that could be causing the Windows CI failures, so trying removing the additional header in meta_data.h* Linting fix* Post-rebase files fixingThese tests were somehow transmuted in transit, I've updated them to themost recent variant of the test helpers.* Strip back interface API to just inputs and outputsThis removes any speculative structures from the generated code and cleans up some of the documentation.* Add header guards and tweak documentation",2
"Adding Variable.update method and improving detection of variable key collisions (#18159)* Update Variable.set() method to take a description argument.* Update Variable.setdefault() method to take a description argument.* Adding a Variable.update() method which will throw a KeyError if the Variable doesn't exist, and an AttributeError if it   doesn't exist in the Database (since a non-metastore Variable can't be modified)* Improved logging around key collisions between different variable backends.*  Updated documentation to warn users about key collisions between variable backends.* If a user has a duplicated key in the metastore and an extra secrets backend, then updates to the Variable will update the   value in the metastore, but reads will read the value in the additional backend.",1

"[FLINK-13169][tests][coordination] Test TaskExecutor failures in fine-grained recovery IT caseThe BatchFineGrainedRecoveryITCase can be extended with an additional test failure strategy which abruptly shuts down the task executor. This leads to the loss of all previously completed and the in-progress mapper result partitions. The fail-over strategy should restart the current in-progress mapper which will get the PartitionNotFoundException because the previous result becomes unavailable and the previous mapper has to be restarted as well. The same should happen subsequently with all previous mappers. When the source is recomputed, all mappers has to be restarted again to recalculate their lost results.",1

They also behave like dict,but this is a different story.The test started to fail in SQLAlchemy 1.4 because it containedassert for the returned set entry to be Tuple, but it also containedthe actual check for length and whether the expected Tuple is inthe set, so assert for instance is pretty redundant.",3
"KAFKA-5140: Fix reset integration testA couple of root causes of this flaky test is fixed:1. The MockTime was incorrectly used across multiple test methods within the class, as a class rule. Instead we set it on each test case; also remove the scala MockTime dependency.2. List topics may not contain the deleted topics while their ZK paths are yet to be deleted; so the delete-check-recreate pattern may fail to successfully recreate the topic at all. Change the checking to read from zk path directly instead.Another minor fix is to remove the misleading wait condition error message as the accumData is always empty.Author: Guozhang Wang <wangguoz@gmail.com>Reviewers: Bill Bejeck <bill@confluent.io>, Damian Guy <damian.guy@gmail.com>, Matthias J.

This is why the portal comes with its own dialogproviding the various common screenshot features (delay, window picking,area selection, etc.). Showing our dialog first is therefore redundant.Also I updated setting the monitor profile only in the case where theloaded image result from the portal did not have an embedded profile.

"KAFKA-5416; TC should not reset pending state if log append is retriedIn `TransationStateManager`, we reset the pending state if an error occurred while appending to log; this is correct except that for the `TransactionMarkerChannelManager`, as it will retry appending to log and if eventually it succeeded, the transaction metadata's completing transition will throw an IllegalStateException since pending state is None, this will be thrown all the way to the `KafkaApis` and be swallowed.1. Do not reset the pending state if the append will be retried (as is the case when write the complete transition).2. A bunch of log4j improvements based the debugging experience. The main principle is to make sure all error codes that is about to sent to the client will be logged, and unnecessary log4j entries to be removed.3. Also moved some log entries in ReplicationUtils.scala to `trace`: this is rather orthogonal to this PR but I found it rather annoying while debugging the logs.4.

Furthermore, the ConnectionManager keeps running even in case of a JobManagerdisassocation. In the wake of the remodelling this behaviour, the PartitionStateChecker andthe ResultPartitionConsumableNotifier which depend on the JobManager association were movedout of the NetworkEnvironment. They are now contained in the SlotEnvironment which will beset up when the TaskManager connects to a JobManager. The SlotEnvironment contains allinformation related to the associated JobManager.

"KAFKA-7011 - Remove ResourceNameType field from Java Resource class. (#5160)The initial PR for KIP-290 #5117 added a `ResourceNameType` field to the Java and Scala `Resource` classes to introduce the concept of Prefixed ACLS.  This does not make a lot of sense as these classes are meant to represent cluster resources, which would not have a concept of 'name type'. This work has not been released yet, so we have time to change it.This PR looks to refactor the code to remove the name type field from the Java `Resource` class. (The Scala one will age out once KIP-290 is done, and removing it would involve changes to the `Authorizer` interface, so this class was not touched).This is achieved by replacing the use of `Resource` with `ResourcePattern` and `ResourceFilter` with `ResourceFilterPattern`.  A `ResourcePattern` is a combination of resource type, name and name type, where each field needs to be defined. A `ResourcePatternFilter` is used to select patterns during describe and delete operations.The adminClient uses `AclBinding` and `AclBindingFilter`. These types have been switched over to use the new pattern types.The AclCommands class, used by Kafka-acls.sh, has been converted to use the new pattern types.The result is that the original `Resource` and `ResourceFilter` classes are not really used anywhere, except deprecated methods. However, the `Resource` class will be used if/when KIP-50 is done.Reviewers: Colin Patrick McCabe <colin@cmccabe.xyz>, Jun Rao <junrao@gmail.com>",1

"Avoid littering postgres server logs with ""could not obtain lock"" with HA schedulers (#19842)* Remove magic constants from global DB locksAnd `create_global_lock` isn't anything to do with session, so I havemoved it to utils.db instead.And as part of this I changed the lock id that `airflow db reset` usesto share one with `airflow db upgrade` -- there's no point blockingupgrade if a reset is going to clobber it halfway through.* Avoid littering Postgres server logs with ""could not obtain lock""If you are running multiple schedulers on PostgreSQL, it is likely thatsooner or later you will have one scheduler fail the race to enter thecritical section (which is fine, and expected).However this can end up spamming the DB logs with errors like this:```Nov 26 14:08:48 sinope postgres[709953]: 2021-11-26 14:08:48.672 GMT [709953] ERROR:  could not obtain lock on row in relation ""slot_pool""Nov 26 14:08:48 sinope postgres[709953]: 2021-11-26 14:08:48.672 GMT [709953] STATEMENT:  SELECT slot_pool.pool AS slot_pool_pool, slot_pool.slots AS slot_pool_slotsNov 26 14:08:48 sinope postgres[709953]:         FROM slot_pool FOR UPDATE NOWAITNov 26 14:08:49 sinope postgres[709954]: 2021-11-26 14:08:49.730 GMT [709954] ERROR:  could not obtain lock on row in relation ""slot_pool""Nov 26 14:08:49 sinope postgres[709954]: 2021-11-26 14:08:49.730 GMT [709954] STATEMENT:  SELECT slot_pool.pool AS slot_pool_pool, slot_pool.slots AS slot_pool_slotsNov 26 14:08:49 sinope postgres[709954]:         FROM slot_pool FOR UPDATE NOWAIT```If you are really unlucky that can end up happening over and over andover again.So to avoid this error, for PostgreSQL only, we first try to acquire an""advisory lock"" (advisory because it's up to the application to respectit), and if we cannot raise an error _like_ would have happened from the`FOR UPDATE NOWAIT`.(We still obtain the exclusive log on the pool rows so that the rows are locked.)* Use same db lock for initdb and upgradedbThey do conceptually very similar things and when one is running theother shouldn't either.

"libgimp: add a new set_i18n() method to GimpPlugIn class.Clearly the old logic for localizing plug-ins was ""core plug-ins first"":* In particular, we were defaulting to the ""gimp*-std-plugins"" domain,  asking plug-ins to override it with libgimp function  gimp_plug_in_set_translation_domain(). Obviously any third-party  plug-in would have to call this function since their strings are most  likely not the same as GIMP core plug-ins.* Moreover this was only for the localization of menu items, which means  we had to duplicate work anyway (simplified for core C plug-ins only  with the INIT_I18N macro).* Also plug-ins had to manage the location of the Gettext catalogs,  which is simpler for core plug-ins with gimp_locale_directory(), but  more annoying for third-party plug-ins which can be installed  basically anywhere (assuming their message catalogs are in their  directory, not centrally installed on the system, especially for  non-UNIX-like packages, with relocatable GIMP, no central package  system and so on).* Finally in this logic of centrally installed catalogs, we were  requesting that the domain name is unique, which makes sense in a  Linux world with well maintained packages to avoid name clashes, not  in a world with people making plug-ins without knowing too much what's  done by their neighbour.So now the new logic is:- By default, GIMP will search for a folder called locale/ on the same  level as the plug-in executable. The Gettext domain will be the name  of the executable folder (and it doesn't matter too much if it's not  unique in such configuration).- This can be disabled by overriding set_i18n() to NULL or  reimplementing it. All our core plug-ins will do this since they will  continue to use the centrally installed ""gimp*-std-plugins"" domain (or  ""gimp*-python"" for Python plug-ins).- When not disabled while the folder is not available, warning messages  will be outputted to stderr, so that plug-in developers can easily  detect what is missing and how to handle it (and how to easily support  internationalization of their plug-in).- gimp_plug_in_set_translation_domain() is removed and a future commit  is going to get rid of _gimp_plug_in_domain_register() because we are  going to get rid of the core-side localization of menu items (with  logic explained in the upcoming commit).",2

"MINOR: Upgrade mockito test dependencies (#12460)## Changes- **mockito: 4.4.0 -> 4.6.1** (https://github.com/mockito/mockito/releases)Most important updates:  - Fixes https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2648 : Add support for customising strictness via @mock annotation and MockSettings https://github.com/mockito/mockito/pull/2650## Why is this change needed?According to the [Mockito documentation](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org/mockito/Mockito.html#when(T)) :> Although it is possible to verify a stubbed invocation, usually it's just redundant. Let's say you've stubbed foo.bar(). If your code cares what foo.bar() returns then something else breaks(often before even verify() gets executed). If your code doesn't care what get(0) returns then it should not be stubbed. While working on the [Replace EasyMock and PowerMock with Mockito for StreamsMetricsImplTest ](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12947) I noticed that described behavior wasn't applied when you create a new `mock` like this.```java        final Metrics metrics = mock(Metrics.class);        when(metrics.metric(metricName)).thenReturn(null);        ... invoke SUT        verify(metrics).metric(metricName); // this should be redundant (according to docs)```After further investigation I figured out that described behaviour wasn't implemented until`v4.6.1`.With this change we are now able to mock objects like this:```java   Foo explicitStrictMock = mock(Foo.class, withSettings().strictness(Strictness.STRICT_STUBS));```- link to docs: [MockSettings.html#strictness](https://javadoc.io/static/org.mockito/mockito-core/4.6.1/org/mockito/quality/Strictness.html#STRICT_STUBS)It looks like I can accomplish the same thing by using the `@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.StrictStubs.class)` instead of the `@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)` so mockito dependency version update is not mandatory, but it would be nice to stay up-to-date and use the latest version (it's up to MR reviewer to decide if we are going to merge this now, or just close the MR and update mockito version later).Reviewers: Ismael Juma <ismael@juma.me.uk>",5

"KAFKA-12867: Fix ConsumeBenchWorker exit behavior for maxMessages config (#10797)The trogdor ConsumeBenchWorker allows several consumption tasks to be run in parallel, the number is configurable using the threadsPerWorker config. If one of the consumption tasks completes executing successfully due to maxMessages being consumed, then, the consumption task prematurely notifies the doneFuture causing the entire ConsumeBenchWorker to halt. This becomes a problem when more than 1 consumption task is running in parallel, because the successful completion of 1 of the tasks shuts down the entire worker while the other tasks are still running. When the worker is shut down, it kills all the active consumption tasks, though they have not consumed maxMessages yet. This commit defers notification of the doneFuture to the CloseStatusUpdater thread, which is already responsible for tracking the status of the tasks and updating their status when all of the tasks complete.Reviewers: Rajini Sivaram <rajinisivaram@googlemail.com>",5

"MINOR: Ensure LocalLog.flush is thread safe to recoveryPoint changes (#11814)Issue:Imagine a scenario where two threads T1 and T2 are inside UnifiedLog.flush() concurrently:KafkaScheduler thread T1 -> The periodic work calls LogManager.flushDirtyLogs() which in turn calls UnifiedLog.flush(). For example, this can happen due to log.flush.scheduler.interval.ms here.KafkaScheduler thread T2 -> A UnifiedLog.flush() call is triggered asynchronously during segment roll here.Supposing if thread T1 advances the recovery point beyond the flush offset of thread T2, then this could trip the check within LogSegments.values() here for thread T2, when it is called from LocalLog.flush() here. The exception causes the KafkaScheduler thread to die, which is not desirable.Fix:We fix this by ensuring that LocalLog.flush() is immune to the case where the recoveryPoint advances beyond the flush offset.Reviewers: Jun Rao <junrao@gmail.com>",1

This also affects layerswith masks, whose progress is now reported together instead ofindividually.Additionally, this commit fixes erroneous group-layer mask croppingduring undo when resizing the image, by properly calling{start,end}_move() on all the resized layers before starting theoperation, and when scaling the image, by only scaling top-levellayers, and letting group layers scale their children themselves.",4

"KAFKA-6683; Ensure producer state not mutated prior to append (#4755)We were unintentionally mutating the cached queue of batches prior to appending to the log. This could have several bad consequences if the append ultimately failed or was truncated. In the reporter's case, it caused the snapshot to be invalid after a segment roll. The snapshot contained producer state at offsets higher than the snapshot offset. If we ever had to load from that snapshot, the state was left inconsistent, which led to an error that ultimately crashed the replica fetcher.The fix required some refactoring to avoid sharing the same underlying queue inside ProducerAppendInfo. I have added test cases which reproduce the invalid snapshot state. I have also made an effort to clean up logging since it was not easy to track this problem down.One final note: I have removed the duplicate check inside ProducerStateManager since it was both redundant and incorrect. The redundancy was in the checking of the cached batches: we already check these in Log.analyzeAndValidateProducerState. The incorrectness was the handling of sequence number overflow: we were only handling one very specific case of overflow, but others would have resulted in an invalid assertion. Instead, we now throw OutOfOrderSequenceException.Reviewers: Apurva Mehta <apurva@confluent.io>, Jun Rao <junrao@gmail.com>",5

"KAFKA-8237; Untangle TopicDeleteManager and add test cases (#6588)The controller maintains state across `ControllerContext`, `PartitionStateMachine`, `ReplicaStateMachine`, and `TopicDeletionManager`. None of this state is actually isolated from the rest. For example, topics undergoing deletion are intertwined with the partition and replica states. As a consequence of this, each of these components tends to be dependent on all the rest, which makes testing and reasoning about the system difficult. This is a first step toward untangling all the state. This patch moves it all into `ControllerContext` and removes many of the circular dependencies. So far, this is mostly a direct translation, but in the future we can add additional validation in `ControllerContext` to make sure that state is maintained consistently.Additionally, this patch adds several mock objects to enable easier testing: `MockReplicaStateMachine` and `MockPartitionStateMachine`. These have simplified logic for updating the current state. This is used to create some new test cases for `TopicDeletionManager`.

We have other versions of this test which use SSL that continue to be with TLSv1.2 on Java 11 to avoid reducing test coverage for TLSv1.2Additional testing for done for TLSv1.3:  - Most tests that use SSL use TestSslUtils.DEFAULT_TLS_PROTOCOL_FOR_TESTS which is set to TLSv1.2.

"[FLINK-7019] [gelly] Rework parallelism in Gelly algorithms and examplesFlink job parallelism is set with ExecutionConfig#setParallelism or with-p on the command-line. The Gelly algorithms JaccardIndex, AdamicAdar,TriangleListing, and ClusteringCoefficient have intermediate operatorswhich generate output quadratic in the size of input. These algorithmsmay need to be run with a high parallelism but doing so for alloperations is wasteful. Thus was introduced ""little parallelism"".This can be simplified by moving the parallelism parameter to the newcommon base class with the rule-of-thumb to use the algorithmparallelism for all normal (small output) operators.

Bugfix: dag_bag.get_dag should not raise exception (#18554)`get_dag` raising exception is breaking many parts of the codebase.The usage in code suggests that it should return None if a dag is notfound. There are about 30 usages expecting it to return None if a dagis not found. A missing dag errors out in the UI instead of returninga message that DAG is missing.This PR returns None when a dag is not found in SerializedDagModel instead of raising an exception,2

MINOR: Move `RequestChannel.Response` creation logic into `RequestChannel` (#9912)This patch moves some common response creation logic from `RequestHandlerHelper` and into `RequestChannel`. This refactor has the following benefits:- It allows us to get rid of some logic that was previously duplicated in both `RequestHandlerHelper` and `TestRaftRequestHandler`. - It ensures that we do not need to rely on the caller to ensure that `updateErrorMetrics` gets called since this is handled internally in `RequestChannel`.- It provides better encapsulation of the quota workflow which relies on custom `Response` objects. Previously it was quite confusing for `KafkaApis` to handle this directly through the `sendResponse` API.Reviewers: Ismael Juma <ismael@juma.me.uk>,0

"Add a way to import Airflow without side-effects (#25832)I know it's been a long-standing issue that it should be possible to import Airflow as a library without side-effects, and while I think the ultimate fix for this is to go through and steadily remove the need to call `settings.initalize()` in `__init__.py`, I am currently working on a project where I would really like to use Airflow without it doing strange things to logging, sys.path, or atexit.As such, this PR wraps the import side-effect in a simple environment variable check that code can use to disable the side-effects for now, while we slowly try and progress towards a ""cleaner"" solution. Without this, I am having to dynamically modify the source code of `__init__.py` in an import hook, and nobody wants that!I don't believe it's possible to write tests for this as Airflow is already imported when tests are running, but if you can think of a way, let me know and I'll have a go. The environment variable name is also up for consideration - I just picked something that looked a bit like a setting, but we can deliberately make it not look like that if we want.",1

Here is a summary of the PR:Public API changes (I will propose a KIP after a first round of reviews):Add TimeWindowedSerializer, TimeWindowedDeserializer, SessionWindowedSerializer, SessionWindowedDeserializer into o.a.k.streams.kstream. The serializers would implemented an internal WindowedSerializer interface for the serializeBaseKey function used in 3) below.Add WindowedSerdes into o.a.k.streams.kstream. The reason to now add them into o.a.k.clients's Serdes is that it then needs dependency of streams.Add ""default.windowed.key.serde.inner"" and ""default.windowed.value.serde.inner"" into StreamsConfig, used when ""default.key.serde"" is specified to use time or session windowed serde. Note this requires the serde class, not the type class.Consolidated serde format from multiple classes, including SessionKeySerde.java for session, and WindowStoreUtils for time window, into SessionKeySchema and WindowKeySchema.Bug fix: WindowedStreamPartitioner needs to consider both time window and session window serdes.Removed RocksDBWindowBytesStore etc optimization since after KIP-182 all the serde know happens on metered store, hence this optimization is not worth.Bug fix: for time window, the serdes used for store and the serdes used for piping (source and sink node) are different: the former needs to append sequence number but not for the later.Other minor cleanups: remove unnecessary throws, etc.Authors: Guozhang Wang <wangguoz@gmail.com>, Vitaly Pushkar <vitaly.pushkar@gmail.com>Reviewers: Matthias J.

"KAFKA-13749: CreateTopics in KRaft must return configs (#11941)Previously, when in KRaft mode, CreateTopics did not return the active configurations for thetopic(s) it had just created. This PR addresses that gap. We will now return these topicconfiguration(s) when the user has DESCRIBE_CONFIGS permission. (In the case where the user doesnot have this permission, we will omit the configurations and set TopicErrorCode. We will also omitthe number of partitions and replication factor data as well.)For historical reasons, we use different names to refer to each topic configuration when it is setin the broker context, as opposed to the topic context. For example, the topic configuration""segment.ms"" corresponds to the broker configuration ""log.roll.ms"". Additionally, some brokerconfigurations have synonyms. For example, the broker configuration ""log.roll.hours"" can be used toset the log roll time instead of ""log.roll.ms"". In order to track all of this, this PR adds atable in LogConfig.scala which maps each topic configuration to an ordered list of ConfigSynonymclasses. (This table is then passed to KafkaConfigSchema as a constructor argument.)Some synonyms require transformations. For example, in order to convert from ""log.roll.hours"" to""segment.ms"", we must convert hours to milliseconds. (Note that our assumption right now is thattopic configurations do not have synonyms, only broker configurations. If this changes, we willneed to add some logic to handle it.)This PR makes the 8-argument constructor for ConfigEntry public. We need this in order to make fulluse of ConfigEntry outside of the admin namespace. This change is probably inevitable in generalsince otherwise we cannot easily test the output from various admin APIs in junit tests outside theadmin package.Testing:This PR adds PlaintextAdminIntegrationTest#testCreateTopicsReturnsConfigs. This test validatessome of the configurations that it gets back from the call to CreateTopics, rather than just checkingif it got back a non-empty map like some of the existing tests. In order to test theconfiguration override logic, testCreateDeleteTopics now sets up some custom static and dynamicconfigurations.In QuorumTestHarness, we now allow tests to configure what the ID of the controller should be. Thisallows us to set dynamic configurations for the controller in testCreateDeleteTopics. We will havea more complete fix for setting dynamic configuations on the controller later.This PR changes ConfigurationControlManager so that it is created via a Builder. This will make iteasier to add more parameters to its constructor without having to update every piece of test codethat uses it. It will also make the test code easier to read.Reviewers: David Arthur <mumrah@gmail.com>",3

"[AIRFLOW-149] Task Dependency Engine + Why Isn't My Task Running ViewHere is the original PR with Max's LGTM:https://github.com/aoen/incubator-airflow/pull/1Since then I have made some fixes but this PR is essentially the same.It could definitely use more eyes as there are likely still issues.**Goals**- Simplify, consolidate, and make consistent the logic of whether or not  a task should be run- Provide a view/better logging that gives insight into why a task  instance is not currently running (no more viewing the scheduler logs  to find out why a task instance isn't running for the majority of  cases):![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1592778/17637621/aa669f5e-6099-11e6-81c2-d988d2073aac.png)**Notable Functional Changes**- Webserver view + task_failing_deps CLI command to explain why a given  task instance isn't being run by the scheduler- Running a backfill in the command line and running a task in the UI  will now display detailed error messages based on which dependencies  were not met for a task instead of appearing to succeed but actually  failing silently- Maximum task concurrency and pools are not respected by backfills- Backfill now has the equivalent of the old force flag to run even for  successful tasks  This will break one use case:  Using pools to restrict some resource on airflow executors themselves  (rather than an external resource like a DB), e.g. some task uses 60%  of cpu on a worker so we restrict that task's pool size to 1 to  prevent two of the tasks from running on the same host. When  backfilling a task of this type, now the backfill will wait on the  pool to have slots open up before running the task even though we  don't need to do this if backfilling on a different host outside of  the pool. I think breaking this use case is OK since the use case is a  hack due to not having a proper resource isolation solution (e.g.  mesos should be used in this case instead).- To make things less confusing for users, there is now a ""ignore all  dependencies"" option for running tasks, ""ignore dependencies"" has been  renamed to ""ignore task dependencies"", and ""force"" has been renamed to  ""ignore task instance state"". The new ""Ignore all dependencies"" flag  will ignore the following:  - task instance's pool being full  - execution date for a task instance being in the future  - a task instance being in the retry waiting period  - the task instance's task ending prior to the task instance's    execution date  - task instance is already queued  - task instance has already completed  - task instance is in the shutdown state  - WILL NOT IGNORE task instance is already running- SLA miss emails will now include all tasks that did not finish for a  particular DAG run, even if  the tasks didn't run because depends_on_past was not met for a task- Tasks with pools won't get queued automatically the first time they  reach a worker; if they are ready to run they will be run immediately- Running a task via the UI or via the command line (backfill/run  commands) will now log why a task could not get run if one if it's  dependencies isn't met. For tasks kicked off via the web UI this  means that tasks don't silently fail to get queued despite a  successful message in the UI.- Queuing a task into a pool that doesn't exist will now get stopped in  the scheduler instead of a worker**Follow Up Items**- Update the docs to reference the new explainer views/CLI commandCloses #1729 from aoen/ddavydov/blockedTIExplainerRebasedMaster",1

"MINOR: Defer log recovery until LogManager startup (#10039)Currently log recovery begins as soon as we instantiate `LogManager`, but when using aRaft-based metadata quorum we won't have configs until after we catch up on the metadatalog.  We therefore defer log recovery until we actually invoke `startup()` on the `LogManager`instance.  This timing difference has no effect when using ZooKeeper because weimmediately invoke `startup()` on the instantiated instance, but it gives us the necessaryflexibility for accurate log recovery with updated configs when using a Raft-based metadataquorum.The `LogCleaner` is currently instantiated during construction just after log recoverycompletes, and then it is started in `startup()`.  As an extra precaution, since we areno longer performing recovery during construction, we both instantiate and start thelog cleaner in `startup()` after log recovery completes.We also convert `LogManager` to use a `ConfigRepository` to load topic configs(which can override the default log configs) instead of having a hard-codeddependency on ZooKeeper.  We retrieve the topic configs when we invoke `startup()`-- which again is effectively no different from a timing perspective than what we dotoday for the ZooKeeper case.One subtlety is that currently we create the log configs for every topic at this point-- if a topic has no config overrides then we associate a copy of the defaultconfiguration with the topic inside a map, and we retrieve the log configs for thattopic's partitions from from that map during recovery.  This PR makes a change tothis series of events as follows.  We do not associate a copy of the the defaultconfiguration with a topic in the map if the topic has no configs set when we queryfor them.  This saves some memory -- we don't unnecessarily copy the defaultconfig many times -- but it also means we have use the default log configs forthat topic later on when recovery for each of its partitions begins.The difference is that the default configs are dynamically reconfigurable, and theycould potentially change between the time when we invoke `startup()` and whenlog recovery begins (log recovery can begin quite some time after `startup()` isinvoked if shutdown was unclean).  Prior to this patch such a change would notbe used; with this patch they could be if they happen before recovery begins.This actually is better -- we are performing log recovery with the most recentknown defaults when a topic had no overrides at all. Also, `Partition.createLog`has logic to handle missed config updates, so the behavior is eventually the same.The transition of the broker state from `STARTING` to `RECOVERY` currentlyhappens within the `LogManager`, and it only occurs if the shutdown wasunclean.  We move this transition into the broker as it avoids passing areference to the broker state into the `LogManager`.  We also now alwaystransition the broker into the `RECOVERY` state as dictated by [the KIP-631 broker state machine](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-631%3A+The+Quorumbased+Kafka+Controller#KIP631:TheQuorumbasedKafkaController-TheBrokerStateMachine).Finally, a few clean-ups were included. One worth highlighting is that `Partition`no longer requires a `ConfigRepository`.Reviewers: David Arthur <david.arthur@confluent.io>, Ismael Juma <ismael@juma.me.uk>",5

"[FLINK-2398][api-breaking] Introduce StreamGraphGeneratorThis decouples the building of the StreamGraph from the API methods.Before the methods would build the StreamGraph as they go. Now the APImethods build a hierachy of StreamTransformation nodes. From these aStreamGraph is generated upon execution.This also introduces some API breaking changes: - The result of methods that create sinks is now DataStreamSink instead   of DataStream - Iterations cannot have feedback edges with differing parallelism - ""Preserve partitioning"" is not the default for feedback edges. The   previous option for this is removed. - You can close an iteration several times, no need for a union. - Strict checking of whether partitioning and parallelism work   together. I.e. if upstream and downstream parallelism don't match it   is not legal to have Forward partitioning anymore. This was not very   transparent: When you went from low parallelism to high dop some   downstream  operators would never get any input. When you went from high   parallelism to low dop you would get skew in the downstream operators   because all elements that would be forwarded to an operator that is not   ""there"" go to another operator. This requires insertion of global()   or rebalance() in some places. For example with most sources which   have parallelism one.This also makes StreamExecutionEnvironment.execute() behave consistentlyacross different execution environments (local, remote ...): The list ofoperators to be executed are cleared after execute is called.",1

"Don't fail DagRun when leaf mapped_task is SKIPPED (#25995)This one was a fun one to track down, and was only a problem when thescheduler ""expanded"" the first mapped task (making it SKIPPED).- The scheduler looks at `add_one` and marks it as SKIPPED.- `unfinished_tis` contains add_one_1, and `_are_premature_tis` changes  the state of `add_one__1`, (which just so happens to be a leaf task),  and the check on line 584 essentially gets confused, as no one  envisaged the states changing!In a reverse of how this normally plays out, if the mini_scheduler inthe LocalTaskJob was disabled then this example DAG would deadlock everytime. (Since that mini scheduler only operates on a partial DAG it can'tever change the whole DagRun state.)Co-authored-by: Ephraim Anierobi <splendidzigy24@gmail.com>Co-authored-by: Tzu-ping Chung <uranusjr@gmail.com>",2

"KAFKA-7414; Out of range errors should never be fatal for follower (#5654)This patch fixes the inconsistent handling of out of range errors in the replica fetcher. Previously we would raise a fatal error if the follower's offset is ahead of the leader's and unclean leader election is not enabled. The behavior was inconsistent depending on the message format. With KIP-101/KIP-279 and the new message format, upon becoming a follower, the replica would use leader epoch information to reconcile the end of the log with the leader and simply truncate. Additionally, with the old format, the check is not really bulletproof for detecting data loss since the unclean leader's end offset might have already caught up to the follower's offset at the time of its initial fetch or when it queries for the current log end offset.With this patch, we simply skip the unclean leader election check and allow the needed truncation to occur. When the truncation offset is below the high watermark, a warning will be logged. This makes the behavior consistent for all message formats and removes a scenario in which an error on one partition can bring the broker down.Reviewers: Ismael Juma <ismael@juma.me.uk>, Jun Rao <junrao@gmail.com>",0

"[FLINK-22276][runtime] Fixes the concurrency issueThis commit fixes an issue where multiple failures can occur close to each other.In that case, the DefaultScheduler's restart logic competes for each of thesefailures. If multiple failures refer to the same Execution, it might be that therestart due to one failure handling cleans up the failure already. This leads toan IllegalArgumentException when archiving the next failure refering to the sameExecution. The issue was that the code relied on ExecutionVertices instead ofExecutions.The new implementation relies on the Executions that were present when thefailure was handled. Therefore, FailureHandlingResultSnapshot is introduced. Itextracts the Execution information from the ExecutionGraph.Additionally, instead of accessing on ExecutionVertex.getTaskNameWithSubtaskIndex()to collect the task name, the new implementation relies onExecution.getVertexWithAttempt(). This enables us to solely rely on the Executionwithout an extra dependency on the ExecutionVertex.The new implementation also removes the add method from RootExceptionHistoryEntry.This makes the instantiation cleaner. ExceptionHistoryEntryExtractor was replacedby the factory methods RootExceptionHistoryEntry.fromFailureHandlingResultSnapshot andRootExceptionHistoryEntry.fromFailureHandlingResultSnapshot as part of this effort.This closes #15640.",0

"KAFKA-5028; convert kafka controller to a single-threaded event queue modelThe goal of this ticket is to improve controller maintainability by simplifying the controller's concurrency semantics. The controller code has a lot of shared state between several threads using several concurrency primitives. This makes the code hard to reason about.This ticket proposes we convert the controller to a single-threaded event queue model. We add a new controller thread which processes events held in an event queue. Note that this does not mean we get rid of all threads used by the controller. We merely delegate all work that interacts with controller local state to this single thread. With only a single thread accessing and modifying the controller local state, we no longer need to worry about concurrent access, which means we can get rid of the various concurrency primitives used throughout the controller.Performance is expected to match existing behavior since the bulk of the existing controller work today already happens sequentially in the ZkClient’s single ZkEventThread.Author: Onur Karaman <okaraman@linkedin.com>Reviewers: Ismael Juma <ismael@juma.me.uk>, Jun Rao <junrao@gmail.com>Closes #2816 from onurkaraman/KAFKA-5028",2

"KAFKA-10199: Handle exceptions from state updater (#12519)1. In state updater, when handling task corrupted exception due to invalid restoring offset, first delete the affected partitions from the checkpoint before reporting it back to the stream thread. This is to mimic the same behavior in stream threads's StateManager#handleCorruption#closeDirtyAndRevive. It's cleaner to do so inside the restore thread, plus it enables us to optimize by only deleting those corrupted partitions, and not all.2. In the state manager, handle the drained exceptions as follows (this is the same as handling all exceptions from handleAssignment): 1) Task-migrated, throw all the way to stream-thread as handleTaskMigrated, 2) any fatal Streams exception, throw all the way to stream-thread to trigger exception handler, 3) Task-corrupted, throw to the stream-thread as handleCorruption. Note that for 3), we would specially distinguish if the corrupted-tasks are already closed (when they are thrown from handleAssignment or not (when they are thrown from the state updater).Reviewers: Bruno Cadonna <cadonna@apache.org>",1

"KAFKA-14204: QuorumController must correctly handle overly large batches (#12595)Originally, the QuorumController did not try to limit the number of records in a batch that it sentto the Raft layer.  This caused two problems. Firstly, we were not correctly handling the exceptionthat was thrown by the Raft layer when a batch of records was too large to apply atomically. Thishappened because the Raft layer threw an exception which was a subclass of ApiException. Secondly,by letting the Raft layer split non-atomic batches, we were not able to create snapshots at each ofthe splits. This led to O(N) behavior during controller failovers.This PR fixes both of these issues by limiting the number of records in a batch. Atomic batchesthat are too large will fail with a RuntimeException which will cause the active controller tobecome inactive and revert to the last committed state. Non-atomic batches will be split intomultiple batches with a fixed number of records in each.Reviewers: Luke Chen <showuon@gmail.com>, José Armando García Sancio <jsancio@gmail.com>",0

"[ARM] Fix int8 NCHWc compute and alter layout (#10839)This PR fixes a bug in TE ARM int8 compute for NCHWc conv2d, introduced in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/10310. The compute itself, not the schedule, is broken for the following reasons:* We are using `n_elems = 8` in https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/e9091d6c68d5d70c28881e5c75bfe72e385c1f4d/python/tvm/topi/arm_cpu/conv2d_alter_op.py#L350. Thus, the innermost axis of the transformed kernel has extent 8: https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/e9091d6c68d5d70c28881e5c75bfe72e385c1f4d/python/tvm/topi/arm_cpu/conv2d_alter_op.py#L375* In the TE compute, we iterate over the innermost axis `ic_s_inner` of the kernel at https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/f6f252f0abc8f621a96506739f9534083d1fe213/python/tvm/topi/nn/conv2d.py#L577. `ic_s_inner` has extent `n_elems` according to https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/f6f252f0abc8f621a96506739f9534083d1fe213/python/tvm/topi/nn/conv2d.py#L566. `n_elems` is 4 by default according to https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/f6f252f0abc8f621a96506739f9534083d1fe213/python/tvm/topi/nn/conv2d.py#L478* The ARM code that calls this compute does not explicitly pass `n_elems`, according to https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/e9091d6c68d5d70c28881e5c75bfe72e385c1f4d/python/tvm/topi/arm_cpu/conv2d_int8.py#L106-L108* Thus, even though the innermost axis of the kernel has extent 8, the TE compute only loops over `n_elems = 4` of the input channel dimension. Initially, I tried to keep `n_elems = 8` in alter layout and fix the intrinsic definition. But `n_elems = 8` breaks tensorization pattern matching, since now the compute is doing 4x8 innermost loop but this intrinsic is supposed to do 4x4 dot product, see https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/7896108fc41663a1fecbb52345194a93278e9e28/python/tvm/topi/arm_cpu/tensor_intrin.py#L467-L479. Setting `num_int8_elements = 8` there does fix the tensorize pattern matching, but the result was still incorrect.Rather than fixing the intrin implementation in https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/7896108fc41663a1fecbb52345194a93278e9e28/python/tvm/topi/arm_cpu/tensor_intrin.py#L492 to adapt for 4x8 dot product, I settled on setting `n_elems = 4` in alter layout. It turned out this change is enough to get the correct output. Moreover, `n_elems = 8` is simply wrong for the dot product path in https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/7896108fc41663a1fecbb52345194a93278e9e28/python/tvm/topi/arm_cpu/conv2d_int8.py#L154-L155 which computes 4x4 dot product in one instruction. @tkonolige I suggest doing perf benchmark again, since the numbers in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/10310 are invalid.cc @mbrookhart @Mousius  @junrushao1994 @vinx13",0

"[FLINK-5262][docs] Introduce Gemfile.lock to avoid dependency range conflictsThe Gemfile for specifying the Ruby dependencies of our documentationhas fixed dependency versions to avoid incompatible changes withdifferent versions of the dependencies. However, Ruby's dependencymanagement allows artifacts to specify ranges for dependencies. This canbe problematic.For instance, we use 'jekyll' version 2.5.3 which depends on'jekyll-gist' ~> 1.0 which means 1.0 >= version < 2.0. This may resolve'jekyll-gist' 1.4.0 which depends on 'octokit' ~> 4.2 which may be 4.2>= versions < 5.0. Too bad, 'octokit' starting with 4.4 depends on Rubyversion >= 2.0 which is not available on our build servers.Since we already use the improved version of Rubys build system called'bundler', we can mitigate this problem by checking in a Gemfile.lockfile which specifies the exact versions of all dependencies required tobuild the docs.This closes #2945.",2

"[FLINK-8801][yarn/s3] fix Utils#setupLocalResource() relying on consistent read-after-write""Amazon S3 provides read-after-write consistency for PUTS of new objects in yourS3 bucket in all regions with one caveat. The caveat is that if you make a HEADor GET request to the key name (to find if the object exists) before creatingthe object, Amazon S3 provides eventual consistency for read-after-write.""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Introduction.html#ConsistencyModelSome S3 file system implementations may actually execute such a request for theabout-to-write object and thus the read-after-write is only eventuallyconsistent. org.apache.flink.yarn.Utils#setupLocalResource() currently relies ona consistent read-after-write since it accesses the remote resource to get filesize and modification timestamp. Since there we have access to the localresource, we can use this metadata directly instead and circumvent the problem.This closes #5602.",0

"[FLINK-3570] [runtime] Use InetAddress.getLocalHost() as heuristic to find local addressThe ConnectionUtils.findAddressUsingStrategy method tries to find out the local address which isaccessible by other machines of the cluster. It tries to connect to a specified address to do so.In case that the no connection could be established, it uses an heuristic. Before it randomlypicked a NetworkInterface which is bound to an Inet4Address, not a loop back address and not alink local address. In most cases it makes more sense to default to theInetAddress.getLocalHost() address instead. This PR replaces the old heuristic with simplyreturning the InetAddress.getLocalHost(). This of course requires that the system on which Flinkis running, is properly configured.This closes #1758.",5

This left its partitions, restorers, state stores, etc around and in an undefined state, causing exceptions when closing and/or opening the stores again.Longer explanation:In AssignedTasks (the abstract class from which the standby and active task variations extend) a commit failure (even due to broker down/unavailable) is treated as a TaskMigratedException after which the failed task is closed as a zombie and removed from running -- the remaining tasks (ie those still in running are then also closed as zombies in the subsequent onPartitionsLostHowever we do not remove the closed task from runningByPartition nor do we remove the corresponding changelogs, if restoring, from the StoreChangelogReader since that applies only to active tasks, and AssignedTasks is generic/abstract. The changelog reader then retains a mapping from the closed task's changelog partition to its CompositeRestoreListener (and does not replace this when the new one comes along after the rebalance). The restore listener has a reference to a specific RocksDBStore instance, one which was closed when the task was closed as a zombie, so it accidentally tries to restore to the ""old"" RocksDBStore instance rather than the new one that was just opened.Although technically this bug existed before KIP-429, it was only uncovered now that we remove tasks and clear their state/partitions/etc one at a time. We don't technically need to cherrypick the fix back earlier as before we just blindly clear all data structures entirely during an eager rebalance.Reviewers: Boyang Chen <boyang@confluent.io>, Guozhang Wang <wangguoz@gmail.com>",5

"[TIR][REFACTOR][API-CHANGE] Change Call.name to Call.op(RelayExpr) (#5863)* [TIR][REFACTOR][API-CHANGE] Change Call.name(string) to Call.op(tvm::Op/RelayExpr)This PR brings a major refactor to the tir::Call structure.The current Call structure uses a string field(name) to identify thefunction/intrinsic being called. This approach is limited as we startto expand TIR to be more structured. In particular, we are interested inthe following aspects:- Type a function and perform better compile time type checking so that we  can find errors early.- Register additional properties about an operator, such as:  - Whether an intrinsic can be vectorized  - What is the adjoint function of the intrinsic(for tensor expression AD)  - Whether the operator has side effect.- Perform specific codegen about an intrinsic if necessary.- Call into another function in the same module.The refactor changes the Call.name field to Call.op.The Call.op field has a RelayExpr type, and we can pass:- A tvm::Op which represents the corresponding intrinsic.- A tvm::GlobalVar for calling into another function in the IRModule.All the current intrinsics are migrated by registering an tvm::Op.Because the unified IR shares a single Op registry. We use the ""tir""namespace for tir related intrinsics, for example bitwise and is now registeredunder `tir.bitwise_and`.To simplify upgrade, we introduce a `tir.call_extern` intrinsicthat allows us to call into arbitary external function without type checking.However, we should move towards more type checked variants in the system.Under the new op design. We should no longer try to pattern match all thespecific intrincis. Instead, we should rely on attr of each Op to do transformation.For example, the vectorization pass depends on the TVectorizable property of the op,which can be registered independently.In this way, we can still grow the number of intrinsics when necessarywithout having to change all the passes.The same rule applies for tensor expression AD. Currently we are performingAD by pattern match on operators like exp, sin, cos. We should insteadchange to the ajoint registeration mechanism like those in relay.Followup refactors need to be performed, including:- Fold the Call.call_type into operator's attribute.- Enrich the operator registry information- Refactor passes(e.g. AD, intrin lowering) to use the attribute based transformation* Fix nms* Fix remaining testcase* Address review comment",1

"KAFKA-10199: Cleanup TaskManager and Task interfaces (#12397)In order to integrate with the state updater, we would need to refactor the TaskManager and Task interfaces. This PR achieved the following purposes:    Separate active and standby tasks in the Tasks placeholder, plus adding pendingActiveTasks and pendingStandbyTasks into Tasks. The exposed active/standby tasks from the Tasks set would only be mutated by a single thread, and the pending tasks hold for those tasks that are assigned but cannot be actively managed yet. For now they include two scenarios: a) tasks from unknown sub-topologies and hence cannot be initialized, b) tasks that are pending for being recycled from active to standby and vice versa. Note case b) would be added in a follow-up PR.    Extract any logic that mutates a task out of the Tasks / TaskCreators. Tasks should only be a place for maintaining the set of tasks, but not for manipulations of a task; and TaskCreators should only be used for creating the tasks, but not for anything else. These logic are all migrated into TaskManger.    While doing 2) I noticed we have a couple of minor issues in the code where we duplicate the closing logics, so I also cleaned them up in the following way:    a) When closing a task, we first trigger the corresponding closeClean/Dirty function; then we remove the task from Tasks bookkeeping, and for active task we also remove its task producer if EOS-V1 is used.    b) For closing dirty, we swallow the exception from close call and the remove task producer call; for closing clean, we store the thrown exception from either close call or the remove task producer, and then rethrow at the end of the caller. The difference though is that, for the exception from close call we need to retry close it dirty; for the exception from the remove task producer we do not need to re-close it dirty.Reviewer: Bruno Cadonna <cadonna@apache.org>",1

Before there were parameters hasEdgeValues and readVertices whichcontrolled whether edge values and vertices shall be read. This is now implicitly controlledby the types of the vertex and edge value. If the type is NullValue for the edge values thenthe edge value won't be read from the given csv file. If the vertex value type is NullValue,then all vertices will have a value of a NullValue instance. If the pathVertices is notspecified and the vertex value type is unequal to NullValue, then the vertexValueInitializeris used for the initialization.Add documentation for Gelly's Scala API method Graph.fromCsvReaderThis closes #1370.",2

"KAFKA-9823: Remember the sent generation for the coordinator request (#8445)For join / sync / commit / heartbeat request, we would remember the sent generation in the created handler object, and then upon getting the error code, we could check whether the sent generation still matches the current generation. If not, it means that the member has already reset its generation or has participated in a new rebalance already. This means:1. For join / sync-group request, we do not need to call reset-generation any more for illegal-generation / unknown-member. But we would still set the error since at a given time only one join/sync round-trip would be in flight, and hence we should not be participating in a new rebalance. Also for fenced instance error we still treat it as fatal since we should not be participating in a new rebalance, so this is still not expected.2. For commit request, we do not set the corresponding error for illegal-generation / unknown-member / fenced-instance but raise rebalance-in-progress. For commit-sync it would be still thrown to user, while for commit-async it would be logged and swallowed.3. For heartbeat request, we do not treat illegal-generation / unknown-member / fenced-instance errors and just consider it as succeeded since this should be a stale heartbeat which can be ignored.Reviewers: Konstantine Karantasis <konstantine@confluent.io>, Boyang Chen <boyang@confluent.io>, Jason Gustafson <jason@confluent.io>",5

Thisworked only based on gimp_item_real_is_position_locked() code whichcalled gimp_item_linked_is_locked() only when it was linked. It did nottake into account the fact that it was an abstract method which couldhave other implementations. In particular the group layer implementationwould call in turn gimp_item_is_position_locked() on each child layer.Basically temporarily unsetting the link was anyway a very ugly hack.The point is simply that we are only interested by the value of the`lock_position` flag for this item, without further ""intelligence"".

"app, libgimpbase: --enable-relocatable-bundle replaces --enable-binrelocOlder --enable-binreloc configure option had basically the same purposeas the newer --enable-relocatable-bundle, though the old binreloc wasonly used for gimpenv.c code.As a consequence, commit 10ce702188 was still not working fine sincegimp_installation_directory_file() also need binreloc enabled (to beactually relocatable).Let's get rid of this whole mess, by implying we want binreloc code tobe used when --enable-relocatable-bundle is ON. We don't need them4macros anymore, since AM_BINRELOC was basically just checking that`/proc/self/maps` was present. But anyway being present at compile timedoes not mean it will be at runtime (nor the opposite). So this test isnot that useful. The binreloc code will anyway fallback gracefully tothe non-binreloc code (i.e. trying to use build-time install paths) ifthe procfs is lacking at runtime.",1

"KAFKA-10895: Gracefully handle invalid JAAS configs (follow up fix) (#9987)Fixes a regression introduced by https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9806 in the original fix for KAFKA-10895It was discovered that if an invalid JAAS config is present on the worker, invoking Configuration::getConfiguration throws an exception. The changes from #9806 cause that exception to be thrown during plugin scanning, which causes the worker to fail even if it is not configured to use the basic auth extension at all.This follow-up handles invalid JAAS configurations more gracefully, and only throws them if the worker is actually configured to use the basic auth extension, at the time that the extension is instantiated and configured.Two unit tests are added.Reviewers: Greg Harris <gregh@confluent.io>, Konstantine Karantasis <k.karantasis@gmail.com>",5

"KAFKA-12154; Raft Snapshot Loading API (#10085)Implement Raft Snapshot loading API.1. Adds a new method `handleSnapshot` to `raft.Listener` which is called whenever the `RaftClient` determines that the `Listener` needs to load a new snapshot before reading the log. This happens when the `Listener`'s next offset is less than the log start offset also known as the earliest snapshot.2.  Adds a new type `SnapshotReader<T>` which provides a `Iterator<Batch<T>>` interface and de-serializes records in the `RawSnapshotReader` into `T`s3.  Adds a new type `RecordsIterator<T>` that implements an `Iterator<Batch<T>>` by scanning a `Records` object and deserializes the batches and records into `Batch<T>`. This type is used by both `SnapshotReader<T>` and `RecordsBatchReader<T>` internally to implement the `Iterator` interface that they expose. 4. Changes the `MockLog` implementation to read one or two batches at a time. The previous implementation always read from the given offset to the high-watermark. This made it impossible to test interesting snapshot loading scenarios.5. Removed `throws IOException` from some methods. Some of types were inconsistently throwing `IOException` in some cases and throwing `RuntimeException(..., new IOException(...))` in others. This PR improves the consistent by wrapping `IOException` in `RuntimeException` in a few more places and replacing `Closeable` with `AutoCloseable`.6. Updated the Kafka Raft simulation test to take into account snapshot. `ReplicatedCounter` was updated to generate snapshot after 10 records get committed. This means that the `ConsistentCommittedData` validation was extended to take snapshots into account. Also added a new invariant to ensure that the log start offset is consistently set with the earliest snapshot.Reviewers: dengziming <swzmdeng@163.com>, David Arthur <mumrah@gmail.com>, Jason Gustafson <jason@confluent.io>",5

"Implementation of Common Subexpression Elimination for TIR (#9482)* Initial implementation of Common Subexpression Elimination for TIR (#703)The goal of this PR is to implement a Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE) pass for TIR, which aims at identifying redundant computations (both within statements and within expressions), and to replace them by a new fresh variable, introduced before the first occurrence of the redundant computation.Note that it does not only try to do commoning on full expressions, but it is also able to do it on subexpressions. For instance, if the program computes the expression (w+x) + (y+z) and the expression (w+x)+u, it will introduce the subexpression (w+x) into a new variable.If we want so, it will be easily possible in the future to make the notion of equivalence between terms more flexible, allowing for instance to identify expressions modulo commutativity (identifying for instance (x+y) with (y+x)), modulo associativity (identifying for instance (x+y)+z with x+(y+z)), etc. Replacing only the function bool EquivalentTerms(const PrimExpr& a, const PrimExpr& b) will be the only thing needed in order to do that. The typical way to rewrite it for such extensions would be to compute a canonical representant of a and a canonical representant of b and to then compare them with the strict syntactical equality.The main CSE pass is declared and implemented respectively in the files common_subexpr_elim.h and common_subexpr_elim.cc.The function Stmt CommonSubexpressionEliminator::VisitStmt(const Stmt& stmt) is a good entry point as it contains many comments about what the pass is doing.The general idea of this pass is that it tries to introduce at the current level (the current root) the computations that are redundant and which are possible to introduce there (they should only contain variables that are in scope). This notion of variables in scope is implemented with a context, which is a vector of pairs (var, MaybeValue). The context is not only used for checking that variables that appear in candidate computations are known at this point, but also for checking if a computation has already been introduced into a variable.For a greater flexibility in the future, there is a strong distinction already in place between :    - Syntactic computations, which are maintained in a hashtable which associates expressions (the computations already seen) to size_int (the number of times the computation has been seen).    - Semantic entities, which are obtained from the syntactic computations by merging equivalent computations (where this notion of ""equivalent"" is customizable). Semantic entities are stored into a vector of pairs (expr, size_int) where, again, the number is the number of times that expr or equivalent computations have been seen.The VisitStmt() method starts by computing the syntactic computations (implemented in an auxiliary analysis), then it merges equivalent computations to obtain the semantic computations. Then it sorts these semantic computations from biggest to smallest in order to always consider first the biggest computations. The rest will essentially be a loop over all these candidates, which will stay sorted.When dealing with a candidate computation, there are three cases that can happen:    1 - Rare case A variable in the context already contains this computation. This variable can't have been introduced by the CSE, as we would have performed the replacements at the same time (see case 2). So this is the case where the user himself (or the previous TIR passes) has written something like ""let x = A in ...A...A...)""    -> In this case, we simply perform the replacements of A with x in the current result. These replacements are done by an auxiliary transform/Mutator, declared and implemented in replace_expr_selected.h and in replace_expr_selected.cc.    2 - Case where we need to introduce the current computation inside a new variable This is the case where all the variables used by the current computation are within scope (i.e. are present in the context) and where our internal heuristic/predicate tells us to introduce this computation into a new variable.    -> In this case, a new variable new_var_i is generated, all the locations that use this computation in result are replaced by this fresh variable (using the same auxiliary Mutator mentioned in 1.), and the current result is replaced by let new_var_i = currentComputation in result.    3 - Case where we can't or don't want to introduce this computation inside a new variable This is the case where we either can't introduce the current computation inside a new variable (because it contains variables that are not yet in scope there) or because our internal heuristic/predicate did not want to introduce it.    -> In this case, we will compute the direct sub-expressions of the current computation (implemented by an auxiliary analysis), and we will add them to the vector of semantic computations so that they have a chance to be considered later. Note that they are added while still preserving the order.    Note that we do not add all the sub-expressions of the current expression but only its direct subexpressions given the fact that we always consider them from biggest to smallest, and given that some candidates are mutually exclusive. Otherwise it would be computationally more intensive and it would pose the problem of cleaning the vector of candidate computations when one of them gets introduced into a variable. Evaluating them lazily by only looking at the direct sub-expressions is at the same time more efficient and simpler.Once the entire vector of semantic computations has been tried, the main function VisitStmt() calls the general dispatcher , which will in turn call the appropriate handlers. The only specific task of overridden handlers will be to update the context appropriately as new variables are introduced into scope (via Let-In, via For loop, etc) or leave the current scope. Thus, they will update the context appropriately before and after the calls to VisitStmt() and VisitExpr() on the child nodes.* Added empty newline at the end of every new file* Rolled-back the pointer to the submodule vta-hw* Improved the CSE by not commoning at the toplevel redundant computations that only appear in one of the possible execution path (for instance, only in the then/else branch of an IF statement). Redundant computations that appear only in a specific execution path are now being commoned at the entrance of their specific execution path instead of earlier at the toplevel.

"KAFKA-13079: Forgotten Topics in Fetch Requests may incorrectly use topic IDs (#11104)The FetchSessionHandler had a small bug in the session build method where we did not consider building a session where no partitions were added and the session previously did not use topic IDs. (ie, it was relying on at least one partition being added to signify whether topic IDs were present)Due to this, we could send forgotten partitions with the zero UUID. This would always result in an exception and closed session.This patch fixes the logic to check that any forgotten partitions have topic IDs. There is also a test added for the empty session situation when topic IDs are used and when topic names are used.Reviewers: David Jacot <djacot@confluent.io>, Jun Rao <junrao@gmail.com>",5

"KAFKA-8407: Fix validation of class and list configs in connector client overrides (#6789)Because of how config values are converted into strings in the `AbstractHerder.validateClientOverrides()` method after being validated by the client override policy, an exception is thrown if the value returned by the policy isn't already parsed as the type expected by the client `ConfigDef`. The fix here involves parsing client override properties before passing them to the override policy.A unit test is added to ensure that several different types of configs are validated properly by the herder.Author: Chris Egerton <chrise@confluent.io>Reviewers: Magesh Nandakumar <magesh.n.kumar@gmail.com>, Randall Hauch <rhauch@gmail.com>",5

[FLINK-21072] Refactor the SnapshotStrategy hierarchy1. The refactoring simplifies the snapshot strategy hierarchy a bit.2.

It introduces the concept of SnapshotResources for the synchronous part which can be later on used for introducing a common SavepointSnapshotResources.This closes #14719,1

"KAFKA-13959: Controller should unfence Broker with busy metadata log (#12274)The reason for KAFKA-13959 is a little complex, the two keys to this problem are:KafkaRaftClient.MAX_FETCH_WAIT_MS==MetadataMaxIdleIntervalMs == 500ms. We rely on fetchPurgatory to complete a FetchRequest, in details, if FetchRequest.fetchOffset >= log.endOffset, we will wait for 500ms to send a FetchResponse. The follower needs to send one more FetchRequest to get the HW.Here are the event sequences:1. When starting the leader(active controller) LEO=m+1(m is the offset of the last record), leader HW=m(because we need more than half of the voters to reach m+1)2. Follower (standby controller) and observer (broker) send FetchRequest(fetchOffset=m)    2.1. leader receives FetchRequest, set leader HW=m and waits 500ms before send FetchResponse    2.2. leader send FetchResponse(HW=m)    3.3 broker receive FetchResponse(HW=m), set metadataOffset=m.3. Leader append NoOpRecord, LEO=m+2. leader HW=m4. Looping 1-4If we change MAX_FETCH_WAIT_MS=200 (less than half of MetadataMaxIdleIntervalMs), this problem can be solved temporarily.We plan to improve this problem in 2 ways, firstly, in this PR, we change the controller to unfence a broker when the broker's high-watermark has reached the broker registration record for that broker. Secondly, we will propagate the HWM to the replicas as quickly as possible in KAFKA-14145.Reviewers: Luke Chen <showuon@gmail.com>, José Armando García Sancio <jsancio@users.noreply.github.com>",1

"[FLINK-10377] Support checkpoint overtaking a savepoint in TwoPhaseCommitSinkThe precondition checkState(pendingTransactionIterator.hasNext(), ""checkpoint completed, but no transaction pending""); in TwoPhaseCommitSinkFunction.notifyCheckpointComplete() seems too strict, because checkpoints can overtake checkpoints and will fail the precondition. In this case the commit was already performed by the first notification and subsumes the late checkpoint.

"KAFKA-13019: Add MetadataImage and MetadataDelta classes for KRaft Snapshots (#10949)Create the image/ module for storing, reading, and writing broker metadata images.Metadata images are immutable. New images are produced from existing imagesusing delta classes. Delta classes are mutable, and represent changes to a baseimage.MetadataImage objects can be converted to lists of KRaft metadata records. Thisis essentially writing a KRaft snapshot. The resulting snapshot can be readback into a MetadataDelta object. In practice, we will typically read thesnapshot, and then read a few more records to get fully up to date. After that,the MetadataDelta can be converted to a MetadataImage as usual.Sometimes, we have to load a snapshot even though we already have an existingnon-empty MetadataImage. We would do this if the broker fell too far behind andneeded to receive a snapshot to catch up. This is handled just like the normalsnapshot loading process. Anything that is not in the snapshot will be markedas deleted in the MetadataDelta once finishSnapshot() is called.In addition to being used for reading and writing snapshots, MetadataImage alsoserves as a cache for broker information in memory. A follow-up PR will replaceMetadataCache, CachedConfigRepository, and the client quotas cache with thecorresponding Image classes. TopicsDelta also replaces the ""deferredpartition"" state that the RaftReplicaManager currently implements.

"KAFKA-12426: Missing logic to create partition.metadata files in RaftReplicaManager (#10282)KIP-516 introduced partition.metadata file to persist the topic ID on the broker. It is created through handling the LeaderAndIsrRequest in ReplicaManager. (See https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10143 for the code path.) RaftReplicaManager was missing the analogue code path for Kip-500 code. Like in ReplicaManager, RaftReplicaManager will now check the partition.metadata file when handling metadata records.However, since we know that all raft topics will have topic IDs, we can simply set the ID in the log upon the log's creation.Updated the ReplicaManager path to do the same on newly created topics.There are also some tweaks to the checking logic to better handle the scenario when the log exists but is not yet associated to Partition (for example, upon startup after a shutdown).Tests added to ensure the file is created and that the correct error is thrown when the id is inconsistent.Added tests for creating the log with the new topic ID parameter.Also adds a few methods to get topic ID from MetadataImageBuilder as this is the most convenient way to get topic ID from RaftReplicaManager.Reviewers: Ron Dagostino <rdagostino@confluent.io>, Jason Gustafson <jason@confluent.io>",5

"MINOR: Fix flaky ConsumerTopicCreationTest (#6727)`ConsumerTopicCreationTest` relied on `KafkaConsumer#poll` to send a `MetadataRequest` within 100ms to verify if a topic is auto created or not. This is brittle and does not guarantee if the request made it to the broker or was processed successfully. This PR fixes the flaky test by adding another topic; we wait until we consume a previously produced record to this topic. This ensures MetadataRequest was processed and we could then check if the topic we're interested in was created or not.Reviewers: Boyang Chen <bchen11@outlook.com>, Jason Gustafson <jason@confluent.io>",5

"[FLINK-28060][Connector/Kafka] Updated Kafka Clients to 3.1.1 to resolve the issue where Flink is unable to commit its offset back to Kafka in case of Kafka Broker becoming unavailable. This should be resolved when the broker comes back up, but due to KAFKA-13563 that doesn't work. Since that fix has only become available with Kafka Clients 3.1.1, this commit updates the Kafka Clients dependency from 2.8.4 to 3.1.1.No interfaces needed to be adjusted.It was necessary to change some of our Bash e2e tests since they still relied on the Zookeeper parameter which has been removed in this version.The other necessary change was adjusting the KafkaConsumerTestBase class since the level of exception is changed in the new Kafka Clients so exception.getCause().getMessage()  throws an NPE in the test case.",3

"KAFKA-7010: Rename ResourceNameType to PatternType (#5205)The initial PR for KIP-290 #5117 added a new `ResourceNameType`, which was initially a field on `Resource` and `ResourceFilter`. However, follow on PRs have now moved the name type fields to new `ResourcePattern` and `ResourcePatternFilter` classes. This means the old name is no longer valid and may be confusing. The PR looks to rename the class to a more intuitive `resource.PatternType`.@cmccabe also requested that the current `ANY` value for this class be renamed to avoid confusion. `PatternType.ANY` currently causes `ResourcePatternFilter` to bring back all ACLs that would affect the supplied resource, i.e. it brings back literal, wildcard ACLs, and also does pattern matching to work out which prefix acls would affect the resource.  This is very different from the behaviour of `ResourceType.ANY`, which just means the filter ignores the type of resources.  `ANY` is to be renamed to `MATCH` to disambiguate it from other `ANY` filter types. A new `ANY` will be added that works in the same way as others, i.e. it will cause the filter to ignore the pattern type, (but won't do any pattern matching).Reviewers: Colin Patrick McCabe <colin@cmccabe.xyz>, Jun Rao <junrao@gmail.com>",1

"KAFKA-8412: Fix nullpointer exception thrown on flushing before closing producers (#7207)Prior to this change an NPE is raised when calling AssignedTasks.closeunder the following conditions:1. EOS is enabled2. The task was in a suspended stateThe cause for the NPE is that when a clean close is requested for aStreamTask the StreamTask tries to commit. However, in the suspendedstate there is no producer so ultimately an NPE is thrown for thecontained RecordCollector in flush.The fix put forth in this commit is to have AssignedTasks callcloseSuspended when it knows the underlying StreamTask is suspended.Note also that this test is quite involved. I could have just testedthat AssignedTasks calls closeSuspended when appropriate, but that istesting, IMO, a detail of the implementation and doesn't actually verifywe reproduced the original problem as it was described. I feel much moreconfident that we are reproducing the behavior - and we can test exactlythe conditions that lead to it - when testing across AssignedTasks andStreamTask. I believe this is an additional support for the argument ofeventually consolidating the state split across classes.Reviewers: Matthias J.

"KAFKA-8755: Fix state restore for standby tasks with optimized topology (#7238)Key changes include:1. Moves general offset limit updates down to StandbyTask.2. Updates offsets for StandbyTask at most once per commit and only when we need and updated offset limit to make progress.3. Avoids writing an 0 checkpoint when StandbyTask.update is called but we cannot apply any of the records.4. Avoids going into a restoring state in the case that the last checkpoint is greater or equal to the offset limit (consumer committed offset). This needs special attention please. Code is inStoreChangelogReader.5. Does update offset limits initially for StreamTask because it provides a way to prevent playing to many records from the changelog (also the input topic with optimized topology).NOTE: this PR depends on KAFKA-8816, which is under review separately.

"Issue 1917 - GIMP-2.99 uses sRGB instead of the user-selected monitor profileSince the space invasion commit, colors entering and leaving aGimpColorTransform were often implicitly converted up to three times,the code was simply not properly ported to babl formats with spaces.Fix GimpColorTransform to only ever transform colors between thespecified src and dest profiles, ignoring the space of any bablformats involved.Also, always return a non-NULL transform, even if the transform couldbe done by a simply gegl_buffer_copy(), this way we can make sure inone central place that transforms are done correctly, no matter ifbabl or lcms is used.Added quite some docs and comments to make clear what happens.",1

"KAFKA-6015; Fix NPE in RecordAccumulator after ProducerId resetIt is possible for batches with sequence numbers to be in the `deque` while at the same time the in flight batches in the `TransactionManager` are removed due to a producerId reset.In this case, when the batches in the `deque` are drained, we will get a `NullPointerException` in the background thread due to this line:```javaif (first.hasSequence() && first.baseSequence() != transactionManager.nextBatchBySequence(first.topicPartition).baseSequence())```Particularly, `transactionManager.nextBatchBySequence` will return null, because there no inflight batches being tracked.In this patch, we simply allow the batches in the `deque` to be drained if there are no in flight batches being tracked in the TransactionManager. If they succeed, well and good. If the responses come back with an error, the batces will be ultimately failed in the producer with an `OutOfOrderSequenceException` when the response comes back.Author: Apurva Mehta <apurva@confluent.io>Reviewers: Jason Gustafson <jason@confluent.io>Closes #4022 from apurvam/KAFKA-6015-npe-in-record-accumulator",5

"KAFKA-13456; Tighten KRaft listener config checks/constraints (#11503)This patch tightens the configuration checks related to KRaft configs by adding the following constraints:* `control.plane.listener.name` is confirmed to be empty in KRaft mode whenever a config object is created as opposed to later when the broker is given the config and tries to start.* `controller.listener.names` is required to be empty for the non-KRaft (i.e. ZooKeeper) case.  A ZooKeeper-based cluster that sets this config will fail to restart until this config is removed.* There must be no advertised listeners when running just a KRaft controller (i.e. when `process.roles=controller`).  This means neither `listeners` nor `advertised.listeners` (if the latter is explicitly defined) can contain a listener that does not also appear in `controller.listener.names`.* When running a KRaft broker (i.e. when `process.roles=broker` or `process.roles=broker,controller`), advertised listeners (which was already checked to be non-empty via the check that the inter-broker listener appear there) must not include any listeners appearing in `controller.listener.names`.* When running a KRaft controller (i.e. when `process.roles=controller` or `process.roles=broker,controller`) `controller.listener.names` must be non-empty and every one must appear in `listeners`* When running just a KRaft broker (i.e. when `process.roles=broker`) `controller.listener.names` must be non-empty and none of them can appear in `listeners`.  This was indirectly checked previously, but the indirect checks did not catch all cases.* When running just a KRaft broker we log a warning if more than one entry appears in `controller.listener.names` because only the first entry is used.* We also map configured controller listener names to the `PLAINTEXT` security protocol by default provided that the security mapping is empty and no other security protocols are in use.Reviewers: José Armando García Sancio <jsancio@users.noreply.github.com>, Jason Gustafson <jason@confluent.io>",5

"KAFKA-13394: Topic IDs should be removed from PartitionFetchState if they are no longer sent by the controller (#11459)With KAFKA-13102, we added topic IDs to the InitialFetchState and the PartitionFetchState in order to send fetch requests using topic IDs when IBP is 3.1. However, there are some cases where we could initially send topic IDs from the controller and then no longer to do so (controller changes to an IBP < 2.8). If we do not remove from the PartitionFetchState and one broker is still IBP 3.1, it will try to send a version 13 fetch request to brokers that no longer have topic IDs in the metadata cache. This could leave the cluster in a state unable to fetch from these partitions.This patch removes the topic IDs from the PartitionFetchState if the log contains a topic ID but the request does not. This means that we will always handle a leader and isr request if there is no ID in the request but an ID in the log. Such a state should be transient because we are either * upgrading the cluster and somehow switched between a new IBP controller and an old one --> and will eventually have all new IBP controllers/brokers.* downgrading the cluster --> will eventually have all old IBP controllers/brokers and will restart the broker/delete the partition metadata file for them.Reviewers: David Jacot <djacot@confluent.io>",5

Each iteration begins with a call togimp_chunk_iterator_next(), after whichgimp_chunk_iterator_get_rect() should be called in succession tofetch a rectangle to process, until it returns FALSE, which marksthe end of the iteration.  Updates to the UI should take place inthe interval between iterations, but not during an iteration.  Theiterator dynamically adjusts the chunk size according to processingspeed, in order to match the target iteration interval.The iterator can be given a priority rectangle, which is processedbefore the rest of the region.  It can also be given arepresentative tile rectangle, defining a regular tile grid;dispensed chunks are aligned to the tile grid as much as possible.",5

It feels like you wouldexpect to always get the same patterns with a same source data. Yetthere is further randomization going on.Oppositely when saving data, and re-loading it later, I would expectonce again to get back the exact same patterns I had when saving thedata. So it would be a way to save the result of randomization (aschances to get back a pattern one liked are slim by definition when it'screated randomly).Right now, it doesn't behave at all like this. Files are only used assome kind of random seed, not as a way to save/load patterns. I feelthis was not the purpose of the file handling here.",2

The cause was most probablythe missing clean-up of a state directory of one of the processors.A node is cleaned up when a service on that node is started and whena test is torn down.If the clean-up flag clean_node_enabled of a EOS Streams service isunset, the clean-up of the node is skipped.The clean-up flag of processor1 in the EOS tests should stay set beforeits first start, so that the node is cleaned before the service is started.Afterwards for the multiple restarts of processor1 the cleans-up flag shouldbe unset to re-use the local state.After the multiple restarts are done, the clean-up flag of processor1 shouldagain be set to trigger node clean-up during the test teardown.A dirty node can lead to test failures when tests from Streams EOS tests arescheduled on the same node, because the state store would not start emptysince it reads the local state that was not cleaned up.Reviewers: Matthias J.

"MINOR: Make the build compile with Scala 2.13 (#6989)Scala 2.13 support was added to build via #5454. This PR adjusts the code so thatit compiles with 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13.Changes:* Add `scala-collection-compat` dependency.* Import `scala.collection.Seq` in a number of places for consistent behavior betweenScala 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13.* Remove wildcard imports that were causing the Java classes to have priority over theScala ones, related Scala issue: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/6589.* Replace parallel collection usage with `Future`. The former is no longer included bydefault in the standard library.* Replace val _: Unit workaround with one that is more concise and works with Scala 2.13* Replace `filterKeys` with `filter` when we expect a `Map`. `filterKeys` returns a viewthat doesn't implement the `Map` trait in Scala 2.13.* Replace `mapValues` with `map` or add a `toMap` as an additional transformationwhen we expect a `Map`. `mapValues` returns a view that doesn't implement the`Map` trait in Scala 2.13.* Replace `breakOut` with `iterator` and `to`, `breakOut` was removed in Scala2.13.* Replace to() with toMap, toIndexedSeq and toSet* Replace `mutable.Buffer.--` with `filterNot`.* ControlException is an abstract class in Scala 2.13.* Variable arguments can only receive arrays or immutable.Seq in Scala 2.13.* Use `Factory` instead of `CanBuildFrom` in DecodeJson. `CanBuildFrom` behavesa bit differently in Scala 2.13 and it's been deprecated. `Factory` has the behaviorwe need and it's available via the compat library.* Fix failing tests due to behavior change in Scala 2.13,""Map.values.map is not strict in Scala 2.13"" (https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/11589).* Use Java collections instead of Scala ones in StreamResetter (a Java class).* Adjust CheckpointFile.write to take an `Iterable` instead of `Seq` to avoidunnecessary collection copies.* Fix DelayedElectLeader to use a Map instead of Set and avoid `to` call thatdoesn't work in Scala 2.13.* Use unordered map for mapping in SimpleAclAuthorizer, mapping of orderedmaps require an `Ordering` in Scala 2.13 for safety reasons.* Adapt `ConsumerGroupCommand` to compile with Scala 2.13.* CoreUtils.min takes an `Iterable` instead of `TraversableOnce`, the latter doesnot exist in Scala 2.13.* Replace `Unit` with `()` in a couple places. Scala 2.13 is stricter when it expectsa value instead of a type.* Fix bug in CustomQuotaCallbackTest where we did not necessarily set `partitionRatio`correctly, `forall` can terminate early.* Add a couple of spotbugs exclusions that are needed by code generated by Scala 2.13* Remove unused variables, simplify some code and remove procedure syntax in a fewplaces.* Remove unused `CoreUtils.JSONEscapeString`.Reviewers: Manikumar Reddy <manikumar.reddy@gmail.com>, José Armando García Sancio <jsancio@users.noreply.github.com>",1

Refactor `ClientState` as well and update the logic of `TaskAssignor` for clarity as well.5.

"KAFKA-9079: Fix reset logic in transactional message copierThe consumer's `committed` API does not return an entry in the response map for a requested partition if there is no committed offset. The transactional message copier, which is used in the transaction system test, did not account for this. If the first transaction attempted by the copier was randomly aborted, then we would not seek to the beginning as expected, which means we would fail to copy some of the records.This patch fixes the problem by iterating over the assignment rather than the result of `committed` when resetting offsets.

"KAFKA-5797: Delay checking of partition existence in StoreChangelogReader1. Remove timeout-based validatePartitionExists from StoreChangelogReader; instead only try to refresh metadata once after all tasks have been created and their topology initialized (hence all stores have been registered).2. Add the logic to refresh partition metadata at the end of initialization if some restorers needing initialization cannot find their changelogs, hoping that in the next run loop these stores can find their changelogs.As a result, after `initialize` is called we may not be able to start initializing all the `needsInitializing` ones.As an optimization, we would not call `consumer#partitionsFor` any more, but only `consumer#listTopics` fetching all the topic metadata; so the only blocking calls left are `listTopics` and `endOffsets`, and we always capture timeout exceptions around these two calls, and delay to retry in the next run loop after refreshing the metadata. By doing this we can also reduce the number of request round trips between consumer and brokers.Author: Guozhang Wang <wangguoz@gmail.com>Reviewers: Damian Guy <damian.guy@gmail.com>, Matthias J.

This means that displaying millisecondscan be misleading since we round every value to tens and it also meansthat 10ms is the lower delay allowed. This limitation is in the GIFformat.Other animation formats may not have this limitation and we try and keepconsistent export UIs. Also the layer tagging for animation uses ""ms""syntax. So I just keep the delay entry as ms, but sets a lower allowedvalue and makes it ""snaps to ticks"" (i.e. snaps to 10 ms increments).Finally I add a tooltip to the field saying ""GIF supports hundredths ofa second precision.""Hopefully this should make things clearer and not mislead people aboutwhat the GIF format allows.",1

"KAFKA-2600: Align Kafka Streams' interfaces with Java 8 functional interfacesA few of Kafka Stream's interfaces and classes are not as well-aligned with Java 8's functional interfaces. By making these changes, when Kafka moves to Java 8 these classes can extend standard Java 8 functional interfaces while remaining backward compatible. This will make it easier for developers to use Kafka Streams, and may allow us to eventually remove these custom interfaces and just use the standard Java 8 interfaces.The changes include:1. The 'apply' method of KStream's `Predicate` functional interface was renamed to `test` to match the method name on `java.util.function.BiPredicate`. This will allow KStream's `Predicate` to extend `BiPredicate` when Kafka moves to Java 8, and for the `KStream.filter` and `filterOut` methods to accept `BiPredicate`.2. Renamed the `ProcessorDef` and `WindowDef` interfaces to `ProcessorSupplier` and `WindowSupplier`, respectively. Also the `SlidingWindowDef` class was renamed to `SlidingWindowSupplier`, and the `MockProcessorDef` test class was renamed to `MockProcessorSupplier`. The `instance()` method in all were renamed to `get()`, so that all of these can extend/implement Java 8's `java.util.function.Supplier<T>` interface in the future with no other changes and while remaining backward compatible. Variable names that used some form of ""def"" were changed to use ""supplier"".These two sets of changes were made in separate commits.Author: Randall Hauch <rhauch@gmail.com>Reviewers: Ismael Juma, Guozhang WangCloses #270 from rhauch/kafka-2600",4

Decrease likelihood of memory issue in CI (#18852)This PR attempts to decrease the likelihood of memory issues forCI for non-committers. The MSSQL and MYSQL Provider and Integrationtests when run together with other tests in parallel (for MSSQL evenstandalone) might cause memory problems (143 or 137 exit code).This PR changes the approach slightly for low-memory conditions:1) MSSQL - both Integration and Providers tests are skipped   entirely (they will be run in High-Mem case so we will see if   there are any problems anyway)2) MySQL - both Integration and Providers tests are run separately   which will lead to slightly longer test runs but likely this   will save us from the occasional memory issues.,0

"Avoid scheduler/parser manager deadlock by using non-blocking IO (#15112)There have been long standing issues where the scheduler would ""stopresponding"" that we haven't been able to track down.Someone was able to catch the scheduler in this state in 2.0.1 andinspect it with py-spy (thanks, MatthewRBruce!)The stack traces (slightly shortened) were:```Process 6: /usr/local/bin/python /usr/local/bin/airflow schedulerPython v3.8.7 (/usr/local/bin/python3.8)Thread 0x7FF5C09C8740 (active): ""MainThread""    _send (multiprocessing/connection.py:368)    _send_bytes (multiprocessing/connection.py:411)    send (multiprocessing/connection.py:206)    send_callback_to_execute (airflow/utils/dag_processing.py:283)    _send_dag_callbacks_to_processor (airflow/jobs/scheduler_job.py:1795)    _schedule_dag_run (airflow/jobs/scheduler_job.py:1762)Process 77: airflow scheduler -- DagFileProcessorManagerPython v3.8.7 (/usr/local/bin/python3.8)Thread 0x7FF5C09C8740 (active): ""MainThread""    _send (multiprocessing/connection.py:368)    _send_bytes (multiprocessing/connection.py:405)    send (multiprocessing/connection.py:206)    _run_parsing_loop (airflow/utils/dag_processing.py:698)    start (airflow/utils/dag_processing.py:596)```What this shows is that both processes are stuck trying to send data toeach other, but neither can proceed as both buffers are full, but sinceboth are trying to send, neither side is going to read and make morespace in the buffer. A classic deadlock!The fix for this is two fold:1) Enable non-blocking IO on the DagFileProcessorManager side.   The only thing the Manager sends back up the pipe is (now, as of 2.0)   the DagParsingStat object, and the scheduler will happily continue   without receiving these, so in the case of a blocking error, it is   simply better to ignore the error, continue the loop and try sending   one again later.2) Reduce the size of DagParsingStat   In the case of a large number of dag files we included the path for   each and every one (in full) in _each_ parsing stat. Not only did the   scheduler do nothing with this field, meaning it was larger than it   needed to be, by making it such a large object, it increases the   likely hood of hitting this send-buffer-full deadlock case!",1

"app: use adaptive chunk size when rendering projectionsIn GimpProjection, use an adaptive chunk size when rendering theprojection asynchronously, rather than using a fixed chunk size.The chunk size is determined according to the number of pixelsprocessed during the last frame, and the time it took to processthem, aiming for some target frame-rate (currently, 15 FPS).  Inother words, the chunks become bigger when processing is fast, andsmaller when processing is slow.  We're currently aiming forgenerally-square chunks, whose sides are powers of 2, within apredefined range.Note that the chunk size represents a trade off between throughputand responsiveness: bigger chunks result in better throughput,since each individual chunk incurs an overhead, in particular whenrendering area filters or multithreaded ops, while smaller chunksresult in better responsiveness, since the time each chunkindividual takes to render is smaller, allowing us to moreaccurately meet the target frame rate.  With this commit, we aim tofind a good compromise dynamically, rather than statically.The use of adaptive chunk sizes can be disabled by defining theenvironment variable GIMP_NO_ADAPTIVE_CHUNK_SIZE, in which case weuse a fixed chunk size, as before.",0

"[FLINK-16408] Bind job blob lifecycle to JobTable.JobThe PermanentBlobCache#registerJob method registers the use of job-related Blobs. Similarly, PermanentBlobCache#releaseJob will release all job-related blobs which makes them eligible for cleanup by the periodic clean up task.Since tasks belonging to the same job should be able to share blobs (e.g. jar blobs for the common user code class loader), the PermanentBlobCache#registerJob and PermanentBlobCache#releaseJob should be bound to the job lifecycle instead of the Task lifecycle. This is what this commit achieves by moving the #registerJob and #releaseJob calls from the Task to the JobTable.Job. Whenever we create new JobTable.Job, we will also call PermanentBlobCache#registerJob. We will only call PermanentBlobCache#releaseJob when we close JobTable.Job.",1

"KIP-101: Alter Replication Protocol to use Leader Epoch rather than High Watermark for TruncationThis PR replaces https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2743 (just raising from Confluent repo)This PR describes the addition of Partition Level Leader Epochs to messages in Kafka as a mechanism for fixing some known issues in the replication protocol. Full details can be found here:[KIP-101 Reference](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-101+-+Alter+Replication+Protocol+to+use+Leader+Epoch+rather+than+High+Watermark+for+Truncation)*The key elements are*:- Epochs are stamped on messages as they enter the leader.- Epochs are tracked in both leader and follower in a new checkpoint file.- A new API allows followers to retrieve the leader's latest offset for a particular epoch.- The logic for truncating the log, when a replica becomes a follower, has been moved from Partition into the ReplicaFetcherThread- When partitions are added to the ReplicaFetcherThread they are added in an initialising state. Initialising partitions request leader epochs and then truncate their logs appropriately.This test provides a good overview of the workflow `EpochDrivenReplicationProtocolAcceptanceTest.shouldFollowLeaderEpochBasicWorkflow()`The corrupted log use case is covered by the test`EpochDrivenReplicationProtocolAcceptanceTest.offsetsShouldNotGoBackwards()`Remaining work: There is a do list here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1edmMo70MfHEZH9x38OQfTWsHr7UGTvg-NOxeFhOeRew/edit?usp=sharingAuthor: Ben Stopford <benstopford@gmail.com>Author: Jun Rao <junrao@gmail.com>Reviewers: Ismael Juma <ismael@juma.me.uk>, Jun Rao <junrao@gmail.com>Closes #2808 from benstopford/kip-101-v2",2

"Fixes warm shutdown for celery worker. (#18068)The way how dumb-init propagated the signal by defaultmade celery worker not to handle termination well.Default behaviour of dumb-init is to propagate signals to theprocess group rather than to the single child it uses. This isprotective behaviour, in case a user runs 'bash -c' commandwithout 'exec' - in this case signals should be sent not onlyto the bash but also to the process(es) it creates, otherwisebash exits without propagating the signal and you need secondsignal to kill all processes.However some airflow processes (in particular airflow celery worker)behave in a responsible way and handles the signals appropriately- when the first signal is received, it will switch to offlinemode and let all workers terminate (until grace period expiresresulting in Warm Shutdown.Therefore we can disable the protection of dumb-init and let itpropagate the signal to only the single child it spawns in theHelm Chart.

"KAFKA-13770: Restore compatibility with KafkaBasedLog using older Kafka brokers (#11946)The `retryEndOffsets(…)` method in `TopicAdmin` recently added (KAFKA-12879, #11797) to allow the `KafkaBasedLog.start()` method to retry any failures reading the last offsets for a topic. However, this introduce a regression when talking to older brokers (0.10.x or earlier).The `KafkaBasedLog` already had logic that expected an `UnsupportedVersionException` thrown by the admin client when a Kafka API is not available on an older broker, but the new retry logic in `TopicAdmin` did not account for this and wrapped the exception, thereby breaking the `KafkaBasedLog` logic and preventing startup.The fix is to propagate this `UnsupportedVersionException` from the `TopicAdmin.retryEndOffsets(…)` method. Added a new unit test that first replicated the problem before the fix, and verified the fix corrects the problem.",0

"The gif save plugin normally asks the user if it's ok to crop the image ifTue Jul 18 23:34:34 BST 2000  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>* plugs-ins/common/gif.c: The gif save plugin normally asks the    user if it's ok to crop the image if there are layers larger        than the image size.  This isn't a good idea if we're running        with run_mode == NON_INTERACTIVE.  Fix similar to that        suggested by Bryan Livingston <bryan@cooltext.com> on        gimp-developer mailing list.   * app/layer.c: Fix for Bug#17347: Scale Layer leaves artifacts.    Basic problem is that scaling a layer when there's a selection        active (eg there's a floating selection) doesn't invalidate        the layer bounds.  Same problem with resizing a layer,        although the bug report didn't mention that.  Fixed by changing        layer_resize() and layer_scale_lowlevel() to call        layer_invalidate_boundary() once done changing the layer.",4

The real fix will be when GTK/GDKfix their API so that it returns what the docs says it should (i.e. asize in ""application pixels"" not ""device pixels""), as it does on X11,Windows, macOS… Then we won't create random max size and we will be ableto properly control our splash size.Note that this neither fixes nor works around the position issue onWayland (in my case, the splash was just always on top-left of thedisplay).",0

"etc: smaller default position and size of main image window.Existing default was requesting a window of size 1024×768 at position(200,100). While it may seem a reasonable default on nowadays displays,it was not on some intermediate size displays which are considered HiPPIanyway.Taking my personal example, my screen is 2560×1440, which is consideredHiPPI by GNOME 3 with a scale ratio of ×2. As a consequence, setting asize of 1024×768 was actually creating a window of 2048×1536, which isalready higher than the screen. Worse, gtk_window_resize() resize thewindow without taking into consideration the title bar, which in my caseadded 74 pixels, so GIMP window started at 1610 pixels of height, muchbigger than my screen size, hence unusable (and for some reason, withthe title bar out of the screen so without knowing Super+click shortcutto move or Super+Up to maximize, people would have a hard time to resizeor close GIMP).This issue only happens at the first launch of GIMP, when no usersessionrc exists yet. Once you resize yourself the main window, thenrestart GIMP, it is fine (as next times, it will use the user'ssessionrc). Yet it is already a bad first impression.For temporary workaround, let's use a smaller 800×600 defaults (whichwill actually span on 1600×1200 pixels + decoration size on scale ratio×2).Still I don't like using arbitrary numbers for window size default.As we see here, it can end up into all sort of weird result. Even morewith all the scale ratio business which didn't exist back in GTK+2.Instead, the defaults should have no size, and our code should justresize to whatever makes the most sense on the current display, which Ibelieve should likely be maximized. Unfortunately I have a hard timewith gtk_window_maximize() which doesn't seem to do anything at all(does GNOME ignore _NET_WM_STATE_MAXIMIZE_* hints when requested byapplications maybe?). So until we find the right system, let's go withthis lower window size defaults at least.",5

"app, libgimp, plug-ins: move Orientation metadata handling into core.Orientation is now handled by core code, just next to profile conversionhandling.One of the first consequence is that we don't need to have a non-GUIversion gimp_image_metadata_load_finish_batch() in libgimp, next to aGUI version of the gimp_image_metadata_load_finish() function inlibgimpui. This makes for simpler API.Also a plug-in which wishes to get access to the rotation dialogprovided by GIMP without loading ligimpui/GTK+ (for whatever reason)will still have the feature.The main advantage is that the ""Don't ask me again"" feature is nowhandled by a settings in `Preferences > Image Import & Export` as the""Metadata rotation policy"". Until now it was saved as a global parasite,which made it virtually non-editable once you checked it once (no easyway to edit parasites except by scripts). So say you refused therotation once while checking ""Don't ask again"", and GIMP will foreverdiscard the rotation metadata without giving you a sane way to changeyour mind. Of course, I could have passed the settings to plug-insthrough the PDB, but I find it a lot better to simply handle suchsettings core-side.The dialog code is basically the same as an app/dialogs/ as it was inlibgimp, with the minor improvement that it now takes the scale ratiointo account (basically the maximum thumbnail size will be bigger onhigher density displays).Only downside of the move to the core is that this rotation dialog israised only when you open an image from the core, not as a PDB call. Soa plug-in which makes say a ""file-jpeg-load"" PDB call, even inINTERACTIVE run mode, won't have rotation processed. Note that this wasalready the same for embedded color profile conversion. This can bewanted or not. Anyway some additional libgimp calls might be of interestto explicitly call the core dialogs.",2

"[FLINK-3674] Add an interface for Time aware User FunctionsThis moves the event-time/processing-time trigger code fromWindowOperator behind a well defined interface that can be used byoperators (and user functions).InternalTimerService is the new interface that has the samefunctionality that WindowOperator used to have. TimerService is the userfacing interface that does not allow dealing with namespaces/payloadsand also does not allow deleting timers. There is a defaultimplementation in HeapInternalTimerService that can checkpoint timers toa stream and also restore from a stream. Right now, this is managed inAbstractStreamOperator and operators can ask for anInternalTimerService.This also adds tests for HeapInternalTimerService.This adds two new user functions: - TimelyFlatMapFunction: an extension of FlatMapFunction that also   allows querying time and setting timers - TimelyCoFlatMapFunction: the same, but for CoFlatMapFunctionThere are two new StreamOperator implementations for these that use theInternalTimerService interface.This also adds tests for the two new operators.This also adds the new interface KeyContext that is used forsetting/querying the current key context for state and timers. Timersare always scoped to a key, for now.Also, this moves the handling of watermarks for both one-input andtwo-input operators to AbstractStreamOperators so that we have a centralground-truth.",1

"MINOR: Default GRACE with Old API should set as 24H minus window-size / inactivity-gap (#10953)In 2.8 and before, we computed the default grace period with Math.max(maintainDurationMs - sizeMs, 0); in method gracePeriodMs() in TimeWindows, SessionWindows, and JoinWindows. That means that the default grace period has never been 24 hours but 24 hours - window size. Since gracePeriodMs() is used to compute the retention time of the changelog topic for the corresponding window state store and the segments for the window state store it is important to keep the same computation for the deprecated methods. Otherwise, Streams app that run with 2.8 and before might not be compatible with Streams 3.0 because the retention time of the changelog topics created with older Streams apps will be smaller than the assumed retention time for Streams apps in 3.0. For example, with a window size of 10 hours, an old Streams app would have created a changelog topic with retention time 10 hours (window size) + 14 hours (default grace period, 24 hours - 10 hours). A 3.0 Streams app would assume a retention time of 10 hours (window size) + 24 hours (deprecated default grace period as currently specified on trunk). In the presence of failures, where a state store needs to recreated, records might get lost, because before the failure the state store of a 3.0 Streams app contained 10 hours + 24 hours of records whereas the changelog topic that was created with the old Streams app would only contain 10 hours + 14 hours of records.All this happened due to us always stating that the default grace period was 24 hours although it was not completely correct and a connected and unfortunate misunderstanding when we removed deprecated windows APIs (#10378).Co-authors: Bruno Cadonna <cadonna@apache.org>Reviewers: Luke Chen <showuon@gmail.com>, Matthias J.

"app: disable parallel asynchronous operations when GEGL_THREADS=1When GEGL_THREADS=1, concurrent access to the same buffer is notsafe, which can result in errors if asynchronous operations areallowed to run in parallel to the main thread (seehttps://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/issues/1721#note_265898.)Disable parallel execution of asynchronous operations whenGEGL_THREADS=1 for now, to fix this.  Ultimately, GEGL should beable to remain thread-safe even when GEGL_THREADS=1.  Note that wewant to execute asynchronous operations on a separate thread evenwhen GEGL_THREADS=1, since the goal here is mainly to avoidblocking the main thread during their execution, rather thanspeeding their execution up (in particular, it's benecifical to runasynchronous operations in parallel even on a single-core machine,while parallelizing GEGL operations generally isn't.)",1

[AIRFLOW-1665] Reconnect on database errorsThis change enables the scheduler to recover from temporary databaseerrors and downtimes. The same holds true for the webserver if runwithout its regular worker refresh.The reconnect logic is based on a truncated exponential binary backoffto ensure reconnect attempts don't overload the database.Included changes:* Switch to recommended pessimistic disconnect handling for engines  http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_1/core/pooling.html#disconnect-handling-pessimistic* Remove legacy pool-based disconnect handling.* Ensure event handlers are registered for each newly created engine.  Engines are re-initialized in child processes so this is crucial for  correctness.This commit is based on a contribution by @vkloginhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2744,2

The GimpImage ""show all"" mode istherefore merely an implementation detail, and shouldn't have anyeffect on displays that don't use ""show all"" mode, or the PDB.The ability to use the image with or without taking its ""show all""mode into account will be facilitated by the next commits.",1

"KAFKA-5236; Increase the block/buffer size when compressing with Snappy or GzipWe had originally increased Snappy’s block size as part of KAFKA-3704. However,we had some issues with excessive memory usage in the producer and we revertedit in 7c6ee8d5e.After more investigation, we fixed the underlying reason why memory usage seemedto grow much more than expected via KAFKA-3747 (included in 0.10.0.1).In 0.10.2, we changed the broker to use the same classes as the producer and thebroker’s block size for Snappy was changed from 32 KB to 1KB. As reported inKAFKA-5236, the on disk size is, in some cases, 50% larger when the data is compressedwith 1 KB instead of 32 KB as the block size.As discussed in KAFKA-3704, it may be worth making this configurable and/or allocatethe compression buffers from the producer pool. However, for 0.11.0.0, I think thesimplest thing to do is to default to 32 KB for Snappy (the default if no block sizeis provided).I also increased the Gzip buffer size. 1 KB is too small and the default is smallerstill (512 bytes). 8 KB (which is the default buffer size for BufferedOutputStream)seemed like a reasonable default.Author: Ismael Juma <ismael@juma.me.uk>Reviewers: Jason Gustafson <jason@confluent.io>Closes #3205 from ijuma/kafka-5236-snappy-block-size",5

"MINOR: Fix unnecessary metadata fetch before group assignment (#8095)The recent increase in the flakiness of one of the offset reset tests (KAFKA-9538) traces back to https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/7941. After investigation, we found that following this patch, the consumer was sending an additional metadata request prior to performing the group assignment. This slight timing difference was enough to trigger the test failures. The problem turned out to be due to a bug in `SubscriptionState.groupSubscribe`, which no longer counted the local subscription when determining if there were new topics to fetch metadata for. Hence the extra metadata update. This patch restores the old logic.Without the fix, we saw 30-50% test failures locally. With it, I could no longer reproduce the failure. However, #6561 is probably still needed to improve the resilience of this test.Reviewers: Rajini Sivaram <rajinisivaram@googlemail.com>",5
